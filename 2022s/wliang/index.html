<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Introduction</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Small history of augmented reality</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When it began, what was the first, etc. (</span><a href="https://www.g2.com/articles/history-of-augmented-reality"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.g2.com/articles/history-of-augmented-reality</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;1992: Louis Rosenburg, a researcher in the USAF Armstrong's Research Lab, created &lsquo;Virtual Fixtures&rsquo;, which was one of the first fully functional augmented reality systems. The system allowed military personnel to virtually control and guide machinery to perform tasks like training their US Air Force pilots on safer flying practices.&ldquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Augmented reality began with the first head-mounted display in 1968 by Harvard professor, electrical engineer, and computer scientist Ivan Sutherland, recognized as the &ldquo;father of computer graphics&rdquo; and for contributing to building Sketchpad. In 1990 Boeing researching Tom Caudell coined the term &ldquo;augmented reality.&rdquo; Through this, USAF Armstrong&rsquo;s Research Lab&rsquo;s Louis Rosenburg created on of the first functional augmented reality systems called the &ldquo;Virtual Fixtures&rdquo; in 1992. This system was meant for military personnel to control and guide machinery virtually for US Air Force pilot training.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the theater production called </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dancing in Cyberspace</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (1994) by writer and producer Julie Martin, augmented reality was brought to the entertainment industry for the first time. Acrobats were placed next to virtual objects on a physical stage to perform. Augmented reality also started reaching popular media in 1998 when sportsvision first integrated the yellow yard marker for NFL games. Although it has been used for more than two decades, many people do not know that it is a form of augmented reality.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Currently, augmented reality has been evolving at a very fast rate.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Body Paragraphs</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Entertainment/Social Media</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Snapchat, Instagram, etc. filters (</span><a href="https://onezero.medium.com/the-power-of-face-filters-as-augmented-reality-art-for-the-masses-65a95fb4a577"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://onezero.medium.com/the-power-of-face-filters-as-augmented-reality-art-for-the-masses-65a95fb4a577</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Snapchat and Instagram created a new age of &ldquo;post-internet art&rdquo; with their filters.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Games</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pokemon Go (</span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/12/technology/pokemon-go-brings-augmented-reality-to-a-mass-audience.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/12/technology/pokemon-go-brings-augmented-reality-to-a-mass-audience.html</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">)&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pokemon Go brought AR to the masses.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Harry Potter: Wizards Unite (</span><a href="https://www.hanekedesign.com/harry-potter-wizards-unite-brings-users-into-the-wizarding-world-with-augmented-reality-technology/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.hanekedesign.com/harry-potter-wizards-unite-brings-users-into-the-wizarding-world-with-augmented-reality-technology/</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Wizards Unite scatters a multitude of AR features across the game. It allows players to create a Wizard ID with colorful, Snapchat-like, AR filters and accessories. Its gameplay unleashes the capability for players to encounter magical items that are projected into their real-world environment. Once those items are successfully collected by casting a spell, players can see them with 360-degree views or even take selfies with them. They can also use portkeys to open portals that allow them to step into their favorite locations in the wizarding world.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><strong>Tools</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Educational tool WWF Together (</span><a href="https://www.worldwildlife.org/videos/wwf-together-app"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.worldwildlife.org/videos/wwf-together-app</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">)&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Personal Experience</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mary Poffenroth&rsquo;s class Biology-10 required us to use the application to learn about the watershed ecosystem.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.worldwildlife.org/pages/helping-the-planet-one-app-at-a-time"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.worldwildlife.org/pages/helping-the-planet-one-app-at-a-time</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;For 10 days in April, Apple and 24 developers worked together to launch Apps for Earth, a global campaign to benefit WWF and help the planet, one app at a time. Through April 24th 2016, WWF received 100% of the proceeds from participating apps in the App Store via both the purchases of any paid apps and the In-App Purchases created exclusively for the campaign. Apps for Earth raised awareness among hundreds of millions of people and generated more than $8 million in total proceeds.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amazon AR View (</span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/adlp/arview"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.amazon.com/adlp/arview</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">)&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;While the retailer had experimented with AR tools in the past, what makes Room Decorator different is that it&rsquo;s capable of virtually adding multiple products to the room at the same time. That means you can visualize how a whole set of new products could fit together in your own space, not just a single item.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><strong>Installation Artworks</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jenny Holzer&rsquo;s text down in Chicago (</span><a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/innovation/augmented-reality-you-can-now-superimpose-publicly-exhibited-artworks-your-home-180976195/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.smithsonianmag.com/innovation/augmented-reality-you-can-now-superimpose-publicly-exhibited-artworks-your-home-180976195/</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;But for the first time, using the same app, art enthusiasts can also superimpose a public exhibit of Holzer&rsquo;s work&mdash;each of the quotes&mdash;in their own houses, or wherever they might be. Instead of seeing the words Suddenly incoherence feels violent, a quote from &ldquo;Citizen,&rdquo; Claudia Rankine&rsquo;s book-length poem, rolling up the sleek Ludwig Mies van der Rohe-designed fa&ccedil;ade of the university&rsquo;s School of Social Service Administration, users can experience this zooming towards them from a distant spot in their kitchen or bathroom.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beatriz Cortez&rsquo; pyramids (</span><a href="https://www.lamag.com/culturefiles/4th-wall-ar-art/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.lamag.com/culturefiles/4th-wall-ar-art/</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">)&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Beatriz Cortez created a mechanical sculpture of a metal pyramid, inspired by ancient Mayan agricultural calendars. Physically, two versions of the piece are located in Los Angeles. A third iteration also exists&ndash;standing near the spot along the Rio Grande River where migrant Claudia G&oacute;mez Gonz&aacute;lez was killed by an American Customs and Border Protection agent&ndash;but it can only be viewed using augmented reality technology.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><strong>Used to raise awareness</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mel Chin (</span><a href="https://melchin.org/oeuvre/unmoored/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://melchin.org/oeuvre/unmoored/</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">)&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Unmoored explores a potential future of melting ice caps and rising oceans filling Times Square. Developed in collaboration with Microsoft, Unmoored allows guests to explore a submerged Times Square in mixed reality, to use their mobile phones to access an augmented reality experience.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After Ice (</span><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/after-ice/id1222419939"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://apps.apple.com/us/app/after-ice/id1222419939</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">)&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;After Ice simulates your location in various data-backed future scenarios of global ice melt and sea level rise. Additionally, it lets you see the NASA-projected* effect of sea level rise accurately within a 100 mile radius of New York City in the 2080s &mdash; within the lifetime of children alive today.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><strong>(To connect to us) San Jose Hidden Histories</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(</span><a href="https://hiddenhistoriesjtown.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://hiddenhistoriesjtown.org/</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">)&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Hidden Histories is a live experience that connects you to the underlying beauty and historic riches of this remarkable neighborhood. Through Augmented Reality (AR) technology, your mobile device becomes a gateway to visions inspired by the milestones that shaped Japantown. You will see and interact with the art, which is overlaid on current-day Japantown. Hidden Histories debuted in June 2021 &mdash; nine AR art installations produced by artists selected by our advisory panel of scholars, historians, and activists. Visit this website for regular updates on the project developments, the artists involved in the project, and the evolving technology of AR art.&rdquo;</span></p>

      <h2>Abstract</h2>

      <p>
        Augmented reality has been explored by many museums and artists. The
        ability to create a form inside of the digital world and place it into
        the real world using a small device like phones is already something
        amazing. As technology grows more and more, it will be even easier to
        connect the digital and real world. Products like Spectacles by
        Snapchat, glasses that bring augmented reality into the simple form of
        glasses, will become more widespread.
      </p>

      <p>
        There are countless other ways that augmented reality can be used. Tools
        like the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) augmented reality application is used
        to learn Biology, an example being the watershed and how other elements
        can affect it. Games like Pokémon Go have also been a big catalyst in
        reimagining the limits of what a game can be. There are also many
        different ways augmented reality already exists as an art form. In
        addition, the internet brings a novel connection to artworks through
        augmented reality. The relationship between augmented reality and art
        can be explored through superimposed installations, site-specific
        installations, and games that utilize real locations and augmented
        reality. In conclusion, augmented reality has the ability to become the
        future of net art.

      <h2>Into Augmented Reality</h2>

      <!--  Introduction -->
      <h3><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></h3>

      <p>
        The development of augmented reality began with the first head-mounted
        display in 1968 by Harvard professor, electrical engineer, and computer
        scientist Ivan Sutherland, recognized as the “father of computer
        graphics” and for contributing to building Sketchpad. In 1990 Boeing
        researching Tom Caudell coined the term “augmented reality.” Through
        this, USAF Armstrong’s Research Lab’s Louis Rosenburg created one of the
        first functional augmented reality systems called the “Virtual Fixtures”
        in 1992. This system was meant for military personnel to control and
        guide machinery virtually for US Air Force pilot training<sup
          ><a href="#2">2</a></sup
        >.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the theater production called Dancing in Cyberspace (1994) by writer
        and producer Julie Martin, augmented reality was brought to the
        entertainment industry for the first time. Acrobats were placed next to
        virtual objects on a physical stage to perform. Augmented reality also
        started reaching popular media in 1998 when sports-vision first
        integrated the yellow yard marker for NFL games. Although it has been
        used for more than two decades, many people do not know that it is a
        form of augmented reality. Currently, augmented reality has been
        evolving at a very fast rate, shown in social media and entertainment,
        games, artworks, and phone applications<sup><a href="#2">2</a></sup
        >.
      </p>

      <!-- Topic 1: Social Media -->
      <h3><strong>SOCIAL MEDIA</strong></h3>

      <p>
        Snapchat, Instagram, TikTok, and other social media applications have
        created a new age of “post-internet art” with their filters. By graphing
        out the facial features of the users of the applications, images can be
        superimposed onto the faces and backgrounds of whatever the camera sees,
        digitally shown to the user on their phone or other devices with the
        application. This breaks the traditional way of viewing art: consumption
        through passive observation<sup><a href="#7">7</a></sup
        >.
      </p>

      <p>
        Normally, there is a border between the artwork and the viewer.
        Computer-mediated realities like augmented reality break that barrier
        and allow for a special immersive experience for all users. Many filters
        do not show any instructions on how to use them, making exploration a
        part of the art exhibition. In an article by OneZero, author Jessica
        Herrington says “AR face filters allow users to try on myriad physical
        possibilities that are impossible in everyday life. AR allows a person
        to make drastic changes to their appearance without any permanence or
        repercussions. This is different from traditional illustration, as it is
        immediate, reversible, and easily shared.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Augmented reality is also slowly entering the entertainment world of
        games, launched into the masses by a game in 2016.
      </p>

      <!-- Topic 2: Games & Entertainment -->
      <h3><strong>GAMES &amp; ENTERTAINMENT</strong></h3>

      <p>
        Video games have always been a source of entertainment and an incentive
        for people to stay home and indulge. However, the game smartphone game
        Pokémon Go which was released in the summer of 2016 did the complete
        opposite. By bringing augmented reality to the masses, Pokémon Go
        created a digital world inside of our real world<sup
          ><a href="#12">12</a></sup
        >. Players would travel around cities and roads to collect Pokémons and
        battle without players, also known as trainers.
      </p>

      <p>
        Pokémon started as a game in 1996 about trainers who collect different
        types of animals and insects, called Pokémon, which were contained in
        small capsules<sup><a href="#9">9</a></sup
        >. The name Pokémon itself is a portmanteau word that combines the two
        words “Pocket” and “Monster”, the initial title of the franchise. Since
        its initial release, Pokémon has been made into an anime, or a Japanese
        animation series, countless games, countless CGI movies, and is
        currently being made into a live-action series as a Netflix
        exclusive<sup><a href="#4">4</a></sup
        >.
      </p>

      <p>
        What makes the game Pokémon Go special from the other games is its
        ability to combine the real world with the digital world. Players could
        use their smartphones as a map to hunt down and capture Pokémon on their
        phones by throwing a Pokémon capsule, or a Pokéball, at the Pokémon.
        Trainers must be at the specific location of the Pokémon in order to
        catch it. In addition, by using the application, users can turn on their
        cameras on the game and capture it as it is superimposed into the real
        world shown on the screen. When moving around in real life, trainers can
        also check-in at different public locations to get extra supplies like
        more Pokéballs. You can also form teams to fight battles in gyms, placed
        in locations around the real world with high foot traffic.
      </p>

      <p>
        Niantic, the software-developing company that created Pokémon Go also
        created an application called Harry Potter: Wizards Unite. In the game,
        “Harry is now a middle-aged man working for the Ministry of Magic and
        gives players the mission to collect magical items called
        “Counfoundables” that have been scattered across the Muggle, or real,
        world”<sup><a href="#6">6</a></sup
        >. Although Wizards Unite did not come close to the number of players
        Pokémon Go had, it was more advanced than Pokémon Go. Niantic reimagined
        the augmented reality experience it could give to the players. Wizards
        were able to encounter magical items and see them in a 360-degree view.
        It was also better at aligning the real world with the digital world.
        Instead of objects struggling to run up or go forward, Niantic was about
        to develop their software to be able to tell the difference.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the future, many other games and imaginary worlds will use augmented
        reality to blend reality and the virtual world. As of the year 2022,
        there are 82 different augmented reality applications in the game
        section of the Google Apps Play store<sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup
        >. Other applications for augmented reality do not have to be for
        entertainment, either. It can also be used as a tool.
      </p>

      <!-- Topic 3: Tools -->
      <h3><strong>TOOLS</strong></h3>

      <p>
        Augmented reality, although new, has already been integrated into tools
        to help humans. One example would be Mary Poffenroth, a Biology lecturer
        at San Jose State University, and her Biology-10 class. To learn more
        about the watershed environment, she has utilized an application made by
        the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) called the WWF Free Rivers. It puts the
        entire landscape into the hands of the user, placing it directly onto a
        table or even a floor. Users can go in-depth into the interactive
        stories of the elements and the animals that habitat of the river<sup
          ><a href="#3">3</a></sup
        >.
      </p>

      <p>
        Shopping has also been made easy using augmented reality<sup
          ><a href="#11">11</a></sup
        >. The online shopping website Amazon has been using augmented reality
        to superimpose furniture into the real space of the customer’s homes to
        show how it would look in the space. It could help in many ways, from
        sizing all the way to color. Each product is sized and rendered to scale
        in the space.
      </p>

      <p>
        To experience augmented reality for themselves and learn about the city
        of San Jose, San Jose State University students can be connected to the
        history of Japantown. Hidden Histories is a live, site-specific
        application used on smartphones and mobile devices. It allows the
        audience to take a self-guided tour around Japantown. The application is
        able to overlay art onto the real images of Japantown for users to
        travel back in time and explore the history of San Jose<sup
          ><a href="#8">8</a></sup
        >.
      </p>

      <!-- Topic 4: Artworks for Change -->
      <h3><strong>ARTWORKS FOR CHANGE</strong></h3>

      <p>
        Augmented reality has also been beneficial to spreading artworks and
        awareness, specifically due to climate change. Many artists have been
        showing what the world would look like due to the continuous melting of
        the ice caps. Multi-disciplinary artist Mel Chin created a digital
        application site-specific art piece in 2018 called <i>Unmoored</i> that
        worked specifically in New York’s Times Square. Through the smartphone
        or mobile devices, individuals can see boats above them that are
        creating their own oceanic traffic jam<sup><a href="#10">10</a></sup
        >. Another example of augmented reality that is used to spread awareness
        of climate change is an application called <i>After Ice</i> by the
        developers Ghostwheel. Using data of the NASA-projected sea levels in
        the 2080s, After Ice was able to simulate the water level in a 100-mile
        radius of New York City<sup><a href="#5">5</a></sup>
      </p>

      <p>
        Artist Tamiko Thiel’s piece, <i>Unexpected Growth</i>, utilizes
        augmented reality to create a personal connection between the audience
        and the art. Their piece creates a space that looks like an abundant
        ecosystem of growing corals and marine life but is actually "growing"
        plastics and waste with fake animals like rubber ducks. His use of
        augmented reality blurs the lines of reality, exposing the audience to
        the harsh truth that is pollution. Allowing the audience to see but not
        interact with the art physically paints a picture of the ignorance of
        the masses while serving as a lens into a world that is not yet, but
        could become a reality<sup><a href="#13">13</a></sup
        >.
      </p>

      <p>
        Understanding what climate change is causing is one thing. Being able to
        visualize what the future holds for our children and grandchildren seeks
        to invoke an emotional response from the viewer. By using augmented
        reality, users can visualize what the current world will look like if
        nothing is done.
      </p>

      <!-- Conclusion -->

      <h3><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3>

      <p>
        Augmented reality has become a novel and unexplored land of potential.
        It has the ability to combine reality with the digital world, breaking
        the barrier of passive engagement by audiences. Through social media and
        video games on smartphones and mobile devices, augmented reality has
        been brought to the masses as a form of entertainment. Furthermore,
        augmented reality can be used for installation works, especially call to
        action.

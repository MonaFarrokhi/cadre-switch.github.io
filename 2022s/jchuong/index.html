        Abstract
      </h2>

      <p>
	      This article discusses why cyberfeminism is needed and how impactful it is when going into cyberspace. It briefly discusses what cyberfeminism is about. It touches on the negative connotations that are related to feminism and how it’s harmful. It continues to explain how cyberfeminism impacts women, young girls, identity, gender, and the LGBTQ. It discusses the perpetuation of misogyny and anti-feminism and how even data systems and algorithms are male-biased.

        Cyberfeminism
      </h2>
	   <p>
        Women have to fight for equal/ fair rights and even basic human decency in the real world but of course, it’s a lot better now. However, when it comes to cyberspace, it becomes a lot easier to revert back to misogynistic ignorant thinking and actions. It’s not even just women that are being harassed, it’s also others who identify besides just male or female, those who are struggling with finding their own identity, and members of the LGBTQ community. Cyberspace is so male-dominated. Anything from video games, to algorithms, it’s been honed towards males. Harassment and misogyny have become so normalized on the internet that some don’t even see the issue anymore, stating that we should simply just ignore or mute them, etc. Well, why should we have to put up with that? We should be fighting for a change in this cruel behavior. Fighting against misogyny and male-dominated cyberspace is something we should do. When looking up the term “cyberfeminism” there is no one, clear, defined definition. Overall, its main point is freedom from social constructs and power structures in cyberspace. Cyberfeminism is important and it approaches the issues of misogyny, sexism, and identity in cyberspace. 
      </p>

	<h2> Negative Connotations of Feminism </h2>
	<p>
        It’s kind of shocking that the negative stereotypes and images that are associated with feminism haven’t really changed since the 1900s. You’d think that people would grow out of such arrogant and outdated thinking but unfortunately, some things never change. The anti-suffrage movement was a movement from 1908 to 1912 that opposed women’s right to vote because it was ‘against nature’. The images from the campaign are exactly what the stereotypes from today are saying: ugly, manly, angry, man-hater, etc. A study by Anna Moore and Sofia Stathi presents that these negative labels are harmful because it makes people hesitant to identify as a feminist or even speak up about it. Their research involves the stereotypes of feminism as a factor that enhances or hinders identifying as a feminist. Many women expressed contradictions, stating that they aren’t feminists but express feminist views. This research also states that women who are exposed to positive feminist stereotypes were twice as likely to identify as one. “Women who self-identify as feminists are more willing to work towards implementing social change collectively” (Moore & Stathi 268). In an online space, these negative images and labeling have evolved but not in a good way. Anywhere from video games to social media, girls always hear/see the same sexist ‘jokes’, ‘go back to the kitchen’, ‘she’s mad’, ‘you’re probably ugly’, things like that whenever expressing feminist thoughts/views.

	<h2>
	Impact on Women and Young Girls
	</h2>
    <p>
        There are many confident and talented young women who have a great set of technology to share with the world. However, when it becomes time to display those skills, they get harsher judgment from peers and get more comments about if they’re even able to handle the job, about physical appearance, and simply, about them being women. Society in every part of the world loves to point out women’s physical appearance, saying certain features are a problem that needed to be fixed. They never focus on inner beauty but on the outer.

        </p>
    <p>
        Agatha Park’s Gangnam Makeover (2020) is an online participant augmented reality (AR) intervention that collects Korean women’s messages and thoughts about beauty and displays them over cosmetic surgery advertisements at Sinsa or Apgujeong stations. The project wanted to turn a place of narrow and shallow definition of beauty into a place where women can share their own versions of beauty in solidarity, a makeover of what beauty is. Many messages talked about inner beauty, having your own standard of beauty, being themselves, and many other heartfelt messages. Korea is one of the places that are well known for plastic surgery. Having plastic surgery itself isn’t a problem at all but the way it’s been advertised. Women have become pressured to look like the standard. These advertisements use words like ‘ complete’ and ‘perfect’ which causes harmful thinking that people must look this way in order to be such. The Gangnam Makeover is a great cyberfeminist art piece that challenges this.

	<h2> Impact on Identity, Gender, and LGBTQ
	    </h2>
    <p>
        Those who identified outside of the traditional male and female had and have a hard time in society. There are always people that are arguing and rejecting the idea that there are more than 2 genders. People who are nonbinary, genderfluid, transgender, and anything in between, are always getting comments about how they’re confused or they’re tricking others when they simply are just trying to be who they truly are.  Bev Yockelson is a trans artist and he made an interesting piece called Hold My Hand Tell Me That You Love Me (2020).

        </p>
    <p>
        This piece is a monologue from a transgender computer named Tom Cruise. Yockelson explains that on the internet, “trans people have complete control over our identities and can manifest our true identities via pronouns, names, and virtual personas”. Online, people are able to construct and experiment with a virtual body or persona. According to Kai Baldwin, “avatar creation can relieve dysphoria and empower transgender individuals to experiment with the embodiment of their ideal physical selves”. Out of the trans gamers that Baldwin interviewed, more than two-thirds of them stated that they used video game avatars to experiment with their ideal physical presentation. Avatars nowadays have so much customization and certain games are not gender locked so the player can wear and add any features and wear whatever they wanted no matter what they identified with. They are freer from any social constructs in cyberspace.

<h2>
	Perpetuation of Misogyny and Anti-Feminism 
	    </h2>
    <p>
        An unfortunate norm is the ignorant thinking of misogyny and anti-feminism in cyberspace, especially when it comes to video games. Female video game characters are always hypersexualized. Their armor, their story, and their role, all sexualized. Rowan Lucas makes a point in this by explaining and analyzing the common female representations in video games; damsel in distress, submissive, or dependent, Ms. male character, the sinister and seductress/sexualized female villain, and of course appearance. There is nothing wrong with wanting female characters to be sexy and confident but the problem is that these are the only options available for female characters. Women aren’t just sexualized, weak, beings but can be strong, masculine, and can fight on their own. If there is a character who breaks the standard, they’re met with backlash, for example, Aloy from Horizon Zero Dawn. There were many who thought she wasn’t feminine enough and one even photoshopped her to have makeup on. There was another debate on why Aloy had a mustache but really it was just peach fuzz that everyone has.

        </p> 
    <p>
         Sometimes such misogyny and anti-feminism become extreme. Gamergate was an online harassment campaign against feminism in video game culture. When looking up gamergate, these three names always pop up: Anita Sarkeesian Zoe Quinn and Brianna Wu. Feminist critic Anita Sarkeesian is the creator of Tropes Vs. Women in Video Games, Zoe Quinn is an indie game developer who created Depression Quest, and Brianna Wu is another indie game developer who created Giant Spacekat. These three were gamergate’s biggest targets. They all received death threats and other harassment that were coordinated through 4chan, 8chan, Reddit, and Twitter.

<h2> Data Systems and Algorithms are Male-Biased
	    </h2>
    <p>
        According to Genevieve Smith and Ishita Rustagi, AI systems are biased because they are human creations. “Humans determine what datasets, variables, and rules the algorithms learn from to make predictions” (Smith & Rustagi). They explain that humans generate collect, and label data that goes into datasets and humans determine what datasets, variables, and rules that algorithms learn from. However, there is a gender digital divide that skews the datasets. The medical industry illustrates this well. According to a MedicalNewsToday article, “Gender Bias in Medical Diagnosis” 2020, gender bias affects misdiagnosis of heart disease, mental health, autoimmune conditions, bleeding disorders, chronic pain, and even COVID-19.

        </p>
    <p>
        Caroline Sinders is aware of such a divide and created a project called The Feminist Data Set (2017 to current). It’s a multi-year-long project that goes through every step of the AI process for data collection and algorithm. “Every step exists to question and analyze the pipeline of creating using machine learning -- is each step feminist, is it intersectional, does each step have bias, and how can that bias be removed?” (Sinders). This project not only combats the bias but also presents itself as social justice art piece, a feminist practice.

    <h2> Conclusion
	   </h2>
    <p>
        So why does cyberfeminism matter? There are so many injustices towards women and those who aren't cis males. It's been normalized so much to the point where people say to ignore it but why should we. When women try to fight back, either just by making pieces of artwork or talking about change, they get hit with backlash. Well, it's time to fight against the injustices, to fight against the mainstream, to challenge the power structure. We need cyberfeminism/feminism to protect and inspire future generations from such harassment. To create solidarity and safety from a judgemental society.

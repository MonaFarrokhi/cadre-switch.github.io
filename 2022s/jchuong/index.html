        Cyberfeminism 
      </h2>
	          <p>
        Women have to fight for equal/ fair rights and even basic human decency in the real world but of course, it’s a lot better now. However, when it comes to cyberspace, it becomes a lot easier to revert back to misogynistic ignorant thinking and actions. It’s not even just women that are being harassed, it’s also others who identify besides just male or female, those who are struggling with finding their own identity, and members of the LGBTQ community. Cyberspace is so male-dominated. Anything from video games, to algorithms, it’s been honed towards males. Harassment and misogyny have become so normalized on the internet that some don’t even see the issue anymore, stating that we should simply just ignore or mute them, etc. Well, why should we have to put up with that? We should be fighting for a change in this cruel behavior. Fighting against misogyny and male-dominated cyberspace is something we should do. When looking up the term “cyberfeminism” there is no one, clear, defined definition. I’d like to think that it’s because it impacts people in so many different ways. Cyberfeminism is important and it approaches the issues of misogyny, sexism, and identity in cyberspace.

	<h2> Negative Connotations of Feminism </h2>
	<p>It’s kind of shocking that the negative stereotypes and images that are associated with feminism haven’t really changed since the 1900s. You’d think that people would grow out of such arrogant and outdated thinking but unfortunately, some things never change. The anti-suffrage movement was a movement from 1908 to 1912 that opposed women’s right to vote because it was “against nature”. The images from the campaign are exactly what the stereotypes from today are saying: ugly, manly, angry, man-hater, etc. These are harmful because it makes people hesitant to identify as a feminist or even speak up about it. In an online space, women come in contact with these stereotypes ever so often. Anywhere from video games to social media, girls always hear/see the same sexist “jokes”, “go back to the kitchen”, “she’s mad”, “you’re probably ugly”, things like that.

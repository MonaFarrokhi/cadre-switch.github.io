	<p> With the emergence of New Media Art within the last few decades, artists are continuously exploring new mediums and tools to help expand their work. 
	While Artificial Intelligence is becoming an increasingly popular instrument for artists, many traditional artists are becoming wary of the arising technology. 
	A common criticism discussed pertains to believing that New Media artists are gaining monetary funds for their AI-created art without actually doing the physical work for the selling pieces. 
	Artists that use AI retaliate by explaining that they both code the AI into creating the pieces as well as use it as a tool to express their own art. 
	They understand that AI cannot fully express the emotions and feelings behind pieces that artists portray, however, they can utilize it to their advantage when assembling their work similar to when photography was originally developed. 
	While many utilize AI in their art, others believe that AI can be harmful to artists as it can overshadow and take over their work in a quicker and more efficient manner. 
	    </p>	
	<p> Traditional medium artists believe that AI-generated art can be controversial due to the fact the artists did not physically make the art. 
	While it could be true that they may have coded the AI, the rate at which the AI is producing and selling the pieces is much faster than the rate traditional artists are able to produce their own work. 
	Richard Lloyd, the head of International Head of Prints and Multiples at Christie's, an international art auction cooperation, told Time Magazine that he tends to think that “human authorship [is] quite important—that link with someone on the other side” (Lloyd). 
	Lloyd, like many other traditional artists, believes there is a lack of emotion and connection between the AI and the artist although he is open to seeing how far AI art can go in the future. 
	Another common criticism said about AI-generated work is that AI art often reproduces pre-existing styles or themes. 
	For example, art made by Alais, an AI from aimade.art, sells NFTs of AI-art stylized as Starry Night by Vincent van Gogh. 
	While it is not a direct copy of Starry Night, the way the painting is made is undoubtedly the same style.

	<p> Many New Media artists recognize the need to upgrade and find different ways they are able to create art. 
	With AI being used in other means such as chatbots and self-driving cars, it is only plausible that AI used to create art could be utilized. 
	What many traditional artists may not take into consideration is the fact that AI needs to be coded and generated by the artists. 
	It takes time and effort to be able to produce a tool, much like it would take traditional artists time and effort to create their work. 
	New Media arts often explain how AI is not meant to replace human emotions or thoughts that go into the work, but rather is used as a tool to create the work similar to when photography was invented in the mid-1800s. 
	The feelings going towards the work are still produced by the artist. They could have felt certain emotions while making their work. 
	    </p> 
	<p> AI-generated art has also made its way into the music industry. 
	Like fine art mediums, many musical artists either denounce or support AI music. 
	Several music artists have come out with their statements about AI music. 
	Claire Elise Boucher, better known as Grimes, a dream-pop and electronic musical artist, believes that AI is the future of music. 
	She believes that live music will soon be obsolete. 
	Nika Roza Danilova, better known as Zola Jesus, an electronic goth singer, responded to Grimes by calling her “the voice of Silicon fascist privilege” in which she believes Grimes is only able to say that as her career would not be affected due to her previous connection with Elon Musk versus many of the smaller signers whose sole income rely on music. 
	As AI art and music is a newer subject, copyright laws around the creation are still in debate. 
	Chris Mammen, a lawyer at Womble Bond Dickinson law firm, told The Verge in an interview that for example, while it is possible to feed an AI Beyoncé music and tracks in order for the AI to create music that sounds like it could be sung by Beyoncé, the original artist is most likely not owed anything due to the fact that the resulting work is not a direct copy and reproduction of the original work (Mammen). 
	This issue is becoming increasingly weary as AI bots are not able to sample artists' voices and music in order to create their own tracks.
	    </p>
	<p>Over the past few years, we have seen the emergence of AI musical artists. 
	Hatsune Miku, a Vocaloid created in 2007 by Crypton Future Media in Japan, has made international waves, even invited at the 2020 Coachella Music Festival. 
	Her concerts consist of holograms while her music is created using a singing synthesizer editor.

	    </p>
	 <p> A more recent AI group is K/DA, a 4-member virtual K-Pop group utilizing characters from the popular video game, League of Legends. 
	K/DA, unlike Hatsune Miku, use actual singers which they credit on their tracks such as Soyeon from the popular K-Pop group (G)-idle or Madison Beer.

	  <p> Dr. Oded Ben-Tal, composer and professor at Kingston University, explains how it is no secret that AI music is growing increasingly popular and this is due to many factors (Ben-Tal, et. al). 
	For one, each singer or member virtually does not age. 
	Hatsune Miku has remained 16 years old since her debut and will continue to remain this age until said otherwise. 
	They are also able to pull off outfits and concepts that regular singers or groups may not be able to. 
	Additionally, because they are virtual, their personas are practically fake making them perfect in the public eye. 
	    </p>
	<p> In 2020, a 4-member K-Pop group, Aespa, debuted under SM Entertainment in South Korea. 
	While K-Pop groups are often seen having concepts of their group and debut, Aespa had an interesting approach to making their group both consist of real members, alongside their AI counterparts. 
	Additionally, they have created a storyline to follow their real and AI-selves in another universe. 
	While most of their concept photos and music videos focus on the four girls, their AI avatars occasionally make an appearance.

	<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Multi User Domains, or MUDs, are a real time synchronous, text-based environment used by multiple users on the internet. These were originally made for Role-Playing based games such as Dungeons & Dragons. These soon evolved into Dungeon Crawling-like RPGs. The Dungeon Crawling-like games were all text adventures, the scenes were described to you through text, and the player would input their actions through text. These soon evolved and branched off into Visual Novels. Visual Novels are interactive, simulator-like games that consist of visuals and multiple choice adventures. These originated in Japan and have become popular world-wide. Although MUDs exist in the present day, I believe Visual Novels are to be held in a higher regard.</p>
	<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Visual Novels come in different categories including: Adventure, Horror, and the ever so popular Dating Sims/Romance. Majority of any other categories falls beneath the mechanics of the game such as shooter or point and click. All of these Visual Novels share a common trait: Lots and lots of narrative and character dialogue. Most of these are formatted with an opaque or solid square with text in front of the character. These games bring complex stories, but as Klotz says “complexity alone is not the measure of what is deemed literature; enjoyment and depth are equally important.” For this reason, I believe expanding the genres of Visual Novels will help youth enjoy reading and equally aesthetic visuals. As a child I’ve had trouble reading blocks and blocks of text within a book, of course I would rather read comic books or even manga. I’m a natural visual learner, and having the chance to see the accurate representation of the characters and settings gave me the ease to see the scene in motion. Leading Visual Novels into the realm of the younger generation will encourage them to read and learn through playing the game. There are a few out there that could fit the category for youth to older teens.</p>
	<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The second most popular Visual Novels are adventure novels. These tend to have either point and click or turn-based fighting. The more popular ones that I can think of are Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney and  the Persona series, but I’ll be talking mostly about Persona 5. Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney is a point and click visual novel that brings the player a chance to investigate crimes and bring them to court to find and accuse the criminals of each chapter. Persona 5 is an adventure, turn-based rpg novel. It has aspects of romance, though it isn’t forced or necessary to continue the story, taken more as extra content. You play as a young boy who gains the ability to travel to another world and see the true personalities of the villains. Through the game, you gain help and purify these villains to repent their sins. These stories may have multiple story lines and endings, but they have been compressed and made into manga series to let those who cannot afford a console itself for the games, they can enjoy it by checking the books out in the library. I know it loses the purpose that games can be literature, however the manga usually doesn’t cover the many options given within the game.</p>
  	<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Another medium that has started to rise are Interactive Films. Although these lose the aspect of literature from Visual Novels, it brings the player a chance to drive the direction of a film series. An excellent example are Markiplier’s Choose your own adventures. The ones that have stuck to me personally are: A Date with Markiplier, A Heist with Markiplier, and his newest one, In Space with Markiplier. These are the main set of series that he’s worked hard on, each having different paths decided by your choices. His newest series, In Space with Markiplier, has a large cast of people set in space and the whole series is free to watch and play along! Another interactive film would be Minecraft: Story Mode.Telltale Games has made some of the best Visual Novel games, though they are on the edge of being Interactive Film-like games and Minecraft: Story Mode was one of them. However Telltale Games fell off the industry in 2018 due to their games not selling so well anymore. That left Minecraft: Story Mode at only two seasons and was no longer continued. It’s still available on Netflix if you’d like to experience a nostalgic story for many.</p>
	<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Back to Visual Novels, the most popular type are Dating Sims. Although this type of genre has been around since the 1980s, their popularity skyrocketed in 1994. One of the best Dating Sims that still gets talked about today is Clannad. This game brings many choices of girls to date, and due to the time it was made, there’s even a short gay route though it’s viewed as a bad ending. Again it was the times. The story begins with a boy named Tomoya Okazaki who’s starting a brand new school year and meets one of the main girls, Nagisa Furukawa. She wants to join the Drama Club, however, it was disbanded after previous members had graduated. She makes it her goal to reform the club, and that’s how Tomoya gets to meet the majority of the girls. Although he has options on who to date, his main love interest is Nagisa. They have an after story that will rip your heart apart. This game got an anime adaption as well, though it does lose a lot of the story due to concentrating on Tomoya and Nagisa’s relationship. If you do not have the patience to play the game on your own, Clannad’s anime makes a second best way to experience the story.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Minecraft is a sandbox type video game that caters to those who want the freedom of exploration and creativity without the constraints of having to follow predetermined goals that the game sets upon you. Developed by Mojang Studios, Minecraft is a Three-Dimensional world in which players can choose between different modalities of survival or creativity. Minecraft is both a very educational, entertaining and creative source for all ages. Working thesis: Minecraft is a game that is able to make censored journalism accessible for everyone and represent these topics in forms of various artwork created in game. </span></p>
</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Censored journalism can easily be described as the suppression of free speech and information. Censored journalism can be managed by various factors such as the government, book imports,  social media silencing, as well as regulated news outlets and much more. One loophole to the censorship is videogames; more specifically in this case, minecraft. Minecraft is generally considered family friendly by all players of this platform and all it takes is one minecraft save file to get information past these censorship walls.</span></p>
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Minecraft creation is built in the form of an island with a white marble library as the centerpiece. The Island is littered with trees that are growing freely. Hidden within the forest is the grand library with a rock sculpted fist at the gate. Clutched by the rock fist is a fountain pen, symbolizing the uprising of the people. The giant library is stunning from both the outside and the inside. All of the details are crafted by hand, individually placed bricks. The interior is well lit with torches and natural light, leading the visitors to the book shelves.  </span></p>
</p>
	    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many countries place restrictions on books that the government deemed “dangerous,” to their regime. Those books often may provide an alternative view to society compared to the sponsored state narratives. In some cases, the government simply erased information in an attempt to change the history that is being passed down. By storing these in the Minecraft library, political news authors and artists can bypass these regulations and make their voices heard. </span></p>
</p>
	     <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Minecraft is one of the most influential and accessible video games in the last decade. This allowed countless minds to express their creative freedom through the popular platform. People of all ages and backgrounds with a computer can experience Three-Dimensional art creation as long as they have a copy of the game. The game even has a feature that allows users to write text in the form of a book. The text within the book can be saved along with the world itself. </span></p>
</p>
	     <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Minecraft is pro-creativity- Players of all ages and backgrounds can be seen exploring the creative possibilities within Minecraft. This could be in the form of buildings, statues, art, complex constructs, and role playing. Much of the creations in Minecraft is a reflection to the player’s values and ideas. As Minecraft is best experienced along with others, players’ creations will also be viewed by those in their server. The setting of the multiplayer games tend to encourage players to thrive for creativity and beauty in their builds.  </span></p>
</p>
	       <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Free speech is important because it is necessary for a democracy. Freedom of speech is necessary for various things like civil rights, religious belief, as well as being able to progress as a society with better information and knowledge. By having freedom of speech we are able to listen to each other's views and beliefs without government interference or other forms of regulation. </span></p>
</p>
	       <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Minecraft can breach this wall of censorship so easily just by having a copy of the game and accessing the library. Just by keeping the Minecraft server up; the library is able to spread and be rehosted on other players' servers as well. The significance of these ideas and how this game is impactful to us and to our freedom of speech is that; the goal of the Minecraft Library is to reach the younger generation and spark these conversations regarding censored journalism. With the game itself being highly accessible to anyone; anyone in the world can have access to these books of unregulated information. </span></p>

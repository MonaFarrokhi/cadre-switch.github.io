        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the realm of traditional art, years are required to be considered a master in the craft. What if those years could be shaved off by half? There was a time when considering viable options to create
            artwork, the assistance of anything but humans would be seen as obscure; We now live in a time today where some type of machine enhances almost every role. We have machines that control heartbeats, tools to measure an object without the
            use of measuring tape, and now machines that are learning to think for themselves. Through this research, I will be exploring artificial Intelligence and the profound influence that it has on the creative workspace. Although there are
            technological advancements that have helped many fields of work, I believe that there is a firm reason to be concerned with our overuse of tools provided by technology.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Almost two decades ago, The International Business Machine Corp designed Deep Blue. A program designed for chess and was able to beat the world chess champion, Garry Kasparov. Nowadays, there are things
            like Deep Blue programmed in everyone&rsquo;s phone. The term AI was coined by mathematician John McCarthy at Dartmouth College in the mid-1950s. Since the introduction of an automated being, there were always many questions that spurred
            my brain. What makes a machine think? How can It react to our actions? This is due to machine learning algorithms, floods of data, and endless horsepower which is called a neural network, but this didn&rsquo;t happen overnight. Before
            the internet, programmers would have had difficulties with their codes because of the lack of being able to map out instructions that covered the abundant possibilities. Neural networks learn without being specifically programmed with
            special rules or logical relationships. This program is built on simple programs that project how biological neurons work. Computer scientists theorize that eventually AI will be completely embodied in who we are as humans, whether it is
            implanted neurally or simply turning the light on for us when it is dark. Being more advanced or absent of human flaws, artificial Intelligence has never been seen as a replacement for the human brain. It is intended to significantly
            enhance human capabilities and contributions.&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Early renditions of AI can be taken as far back as the Tin Man from The Wizard of Oz. A man-made metal that is fully functional, responds to voice commands, and does not contain a working heart. From 1957
            to 1974, the idea and concept of Artificial Intelligence was beginning to take off. In the beginning, it cost approximately 200,000 dollars US a month to even use a computer. But from that introduction, computers became much more
            available to the public at a reasonable price. Still nothing to the accessibility that we are offered now, it was a point in time where the possibilities were endless. Machine learning algorithms were becoming more advanced and
            scientists were better equipped in aiding a solution. An idea was posed in the hit film in 1986, &ldquo;Short Circuit&rdquo; where an AI was to become the first US citizen. Despite being written completely for fiction, little did those
            writers know that in 30 years, their fiction would become reality. In 2017, the robot Sophia was given citizenship in Saudi Arabia, becoming the first robot to become a citizen in history. Sophia was created in Hong Kong by the robotics
            company Hanson Robotics. Carrying the form of a human face, Sophia can tell jokes, respond to questions, and can carry on a conversation. Experts believe that AI such as Sophia marks the beginning of the fourth industrial revolution.
            Though coming off as a model citizen, there comes the controversy. From an ethical and legal standpoint, granting citizenship to a nonliving being may be the beginning of a very messy future in terms of legal issues. This would raise the
            point of who to blame if there was a death or injury caused by Artificial Intelligence, the actual robot, or the programmers?</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In many cases all over the world, the strong connection we carry with our technological devices has become somewhat of an extension of our minds and body. Some of my earliest memories of AI can be traced
            back all the way to the early 90s when I first watch Terminator 2. James Cameron's vision for the film I believe was to prepare for the new wave of technological advancements. From here, the fear of our heavy reliance on technology would
            be our downfall was foreshadowed. Though in this story, a reliance on technology has very well saved this man&rsquo;s life.&nbsp; In 2018, a Japanese man named Akihiko Kondo hit the news when he married a Hologram of a virtual pop star,
            Hatsune Miku. This is a prime example of the evolution of how we perceive a non-living being. Being able to communicate and build a real relationship with a being that is non-human may seem farfetched, but people believe that love can
            take many forms, even if it appears to be morally strange. Though Hatusune had spent at least 17,000 dollars in the US to hold a wedding ceremony with at least 39 friends in attendance, their marriage has not been fully recognized by the
            Japanese government. It may seem like the next step in relationships unfortunately, the creators of Hatsune discontinued the AI service which serves like an Alexa or Siri. It's quite intriguing to see how a fictional character can
            provide the sustenance normally provided by another human being. Is this a step too far or is this the love story the world has been waiting for?&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The idea of the &ldquo;struggling artist&rdquo; is a concept that still stands strong in the community of starving college students, but does this apply to AI artists? Going back to&nbsp; Starting college,
            learning about priceless art and how the value of the work can be based on the materials used or on the artists that created it. But one thing that alluded to my understanding is the price of digital art? How can you put a price on a
            film that is made for artistic purposes? Or an animation when it is not being used as an asset in a major motion film? With the popularity of NFT collecting and trading, that answer had been answered. But with programmers creating AI
            specifically to create trendy NFTs, we have a potential flood of pieces of work being sold for thousands of dollars without the reliance on any creativity. It is still quite early for NFT trading and it is hard to tell if this is just a
            trend for the rich and their lucrative spending habits or is this the answer to the call of the struggling digital artist?&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now with the exciting future of self-driving cars and talking robots, how is the youth affected by this technological boom? Researchers are beginning to learn more about the relationships that the youth is
            building with their technological devices. As kids are growing into a future where tablets have become the new book, there will be expectations for the mental state and education taken into consideration. This communication with
            nonliving beings could affect the way children establish real relationships in the real world. There may be a chance that the comfort from a pet or an activity can be easily replaced by youtube videos and influencers like Jake Paul. From
            the internet, there are even more opportunities to learn about the world but may also pose a threat to the social future of our youth. Management and moderation over the content that the children are looking at may be solutions to
            negative influences on the Internet.&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So whether you are driving down the street or going grocery shopping, the use of AI is just going to get smarter and faster. Even affecting the art market and possibly deciding on what is popular or
            trending. We can only prepare and adapt to the ever-changing world. From early beginnings to open endings, it's hard to see how much AI will affect the creative workspace but it is clear to see that it will have a drastic one. </span></p>

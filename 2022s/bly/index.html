<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the realm of traditional art, years are required to be considered a master in the craft. What if those years could be shaved off by half? There was a time when considering viable options to create artwork, the assistance of anything but humans would be seen as obscure; We now live in a time today where almost every role is enhanced by some type of machine. We have machines that control heartbeats, tools to measure an object without the use of measuring tape, and now machines that are learning to think for themselves. Through this research, I will be exploring artificial Intelligence and the profound influence that it has on the creative workflow. Although there are technological advancements that have helped many fields of work, I believe that there is a firm reason to be concerned with our overuse of tools provided by technology.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Almost two decades ago, The International Business Machine Corp designed Deep Blue. A program designed for chess and was able to beat the world chess champion, Garry Kasparov. Nowadays, there are things like Deep Blue programmed in everyone&rsquo;s phone. The term AI was coined by mathematician John McCarthy at Dartmouth College in the mid-1950s. Since the introduction of an automated being, there were always many questions that spurred my brain. What makes a machine think? How can It react to our actions? This is due to machine learning algorithms, floods of data, and endless horsepower which is called a neural network, but this didn&rsquo;t happen overnight. Before the internet, programmers would have had difficulties with their codes because of the lack of being able to map out instructions that covered the abundant possibilities. Neural networks learn without being specifically programmed with special rules or logical relationships. This program is built on simple programs that project how biological neurons work. Computer scientists theorize that eventually AI will be completely embodied in who we are as humans, whether it is implanted neurally or simply turning the light on for us when it is dark. Being more advanced or absent of human flaws, artificial Intelligence has never been seen as a replacement for the human brain. It is intended to significantly enhance human capabilities and contributions.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Early renditions of AI can be taken as far back as the Tin Man from The Wizard of Oz. A man-made metal that is fully functional, responds to voice commands and does not contain a working heart. From 1957 to 1974, the idea and concept of Artificial Intelligence was beginning to take off. In the beginning, it cost approximately 200,000 dollars US a month to even use a computer. But from that introduction, computers became much more available to the public at a reasonable price. Still nothing to the accessibility that we are offered now, it was a point in time where the possibilities were endless. Machine learning algorithms were becoming more advanced and scientists were better equipped in aiding a solution.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some of my earliest memories of AI can be traced back all the way to the early 90s when I first watch Terminator 2. James Cameron's vision for the film I believe was to prepare for the new wave of technological advancements. From here, the fear of our heavy reliance on technology would be our downfall was foreshadowed. In 2018, a Japanese man named Akihiko Kondo hit the news when he married a Hologram of a virtual pop star, Hatsune Miku. This is a prime example of the evolution of how we perceive a non-living being. Being able to communicate and build a real relationship with a being that is non-human may seem farfetched, but people believe that love can take many forms, even if it appears to be morally strange. Though Hatusune had spent at least 17,000 dollars in the US to hold a wedding ceremony with at least 39 friends in attendance, their marriage has not been fully recognized by the Japanese government. It may seem like the next step in relationships unfortunately, the creators of Hatsune discontinued the AI service which serves like an Alexa or Siri. It's quite intriguing to see how a fictional character can provide the sustenance normally provided by another human being. Is this a step too far or is this the love story the world has been waiting for?&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Starting college, learning about priceless art and how the value of the work can be based on the historical relevance or on the artists that created it. But one thing that alluded to my understanding is the price of digital art? How can you put a price on a film? Or an animation when it is not being used as an asset in a major motion film?&nbsp; </span></p>

        Abstract
      </h2>
      <p>
         Cyberfeminism envelopes feminist theories and social criticism that pertains to technology.
         Posthumanism within the cyberfeminist definition is connected to the practice of online roleplaying.
         Online users who roleplay through adopting fursonas, online multiplayer video games, or lifestyle games like The Sims are examples of individuals pursuing virtual bodies.
         Though anonymity provides privacy and protection from judgment, unmonitored interactions across social media platforms places users of all ages at a risk of endangering minors from inappropriate content and predators.
         The concept of creating a virtual body is interesting and liberating from a perspective of achieving ones’ desires, but virtual spaces need to work towards keeping the space safe.
      </p>

<h2>
  Introduction
</h2>
      <p>
        Cyberfeminism has evolved since its manifestation in the 90s to early 2000s as technology advances for virtual spaces and online social communities that encompasses different areas of feminist critiques and theories.
        Writer Alex Galloway reports on cyberfeminism in order to approach the conversation on technology of the late 90s and feminism in <a class="inline_disabled" href="http://switch.sjsu.edu/archive/nextswitch/switch_engine/front/front.php%3Fartc=225.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">“A Report on Cyberfeminism: Sadie Plant relative to VNS Matrix”.</a>
        Galloway’s article mentions the idea that virtual space allows internet users to participate in online communities that give them an agency over their bodies that will allow them to align with their identity.
        “Posthumanism” is the concept of a soul or entity that exists in a state that succeeds a physical human body.
         This posthuman body gives online users another form of agency and potentially an outlet for creativity that may not be achievable without tools like video games, community forums, and social media.
         For example, trans bodies in the queer community can benefit from the concept of posthumanism by exploring their identity meanwhile safely exist under anonymity within a community while expressing themselves.
         Acknowledging and connecting posthumanism to diverse modern day online examples may uncover a further understanding of how cyberfeminism can relate in modern day context.
      </p>

      <h2>
        Role Play
      </h2>
      <p>The practice of role-playing online has been around since the beginning of chat rooms and direct messaging, and continues to exist in social media spaces like Twitter and Tumblr.
        <a class="inline_disabled" href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/4x3adw/the-strange-world-of-internet-roleplay-is-getting-less-strange" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Maintaining a fictional online identity can be a lifestyle </a>
         that could have been claimed by cyberfeminists if they analyzed the practice today. </p>

      </figure>
   <p>Anyone can create an account on a website and create a profile to reflect the character they wish to role play.
     Figures one and two are screenshots from Twitter and Tumblr, where different accounts interact with each other and write open-ended dialogue that invites the other account to respond.
     The Twitter exchange features two accounts dedicated to role playing their designated characters, whereas the Tumblr interaction features two different accounts adopting characters for the role play from completely different series as a joke.
     Both demonstrations of role play are examples of consensual social interactions that happen online, where anyone can freely socialize with others without knowing one another on a personal level and the only context that matters is the content of the interaction.
     This form of anonymity creates boundaries that can protect the privacy of role players and provide freedom of expression through collaborative fiction. </p>
      <h2>Furries</h2>

      <p>The concept of posthumanism resonates with roleplayers as it invites creativity and social interaction for communities who need protection from judgment and a sense of community.
         The furry community thrives through online roleplay because online users can adopt a “fursona”- an avatar that the user has created to represent their presence online visualized through an anthropomorphic animal. </p>

           <br />
         </figure>
         <p>Furries, or members of the furry community, align with the concept of posthumanism through their fursonas.
           The appeal behind fursonas can be seen in concept art for a fursona’s avatar along with expressing different personal characteristics such as niche hobbies, gender, sexuality, aesthetic, identity, etc.
            LGBTQIA+ furries embrace the creative and colorful aspects of being a member of the furry community to   <a class="inline_disabled" href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/4x3adw/the-strange-world-of-internet-roleplay-is-getting-less-strange" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> express their identity </a> and have a sense of community online.
            From a cyberfeminist perspective, furries and roleplay create a safe space for gender expression and consensual social interaction free from judgment.</p>

      <h2>Simulation role-playing games</h2>
      <p>Video games that provide outlets for creative expression act as a virtual online space that aligns with the concept of posthumanism through customization and creative fiction.
        Simulation role-playing games like Animal Crossing, The Sims, or Stardew Valley concentrate on the customization experience more so than the social aspect. </p>
        <img src="/2022s/images/Sims.png" alt="Cover art for The Sims 4" width="50%"/><br/>
        <h4>Cover for The Sims 4<i/>

        In The Sims, the player has the creative freedom to create a Sim, or an avatar, down to their voice and physical appearance along with choosing a career and building a home for their Sim.
       The player decides all of the actions and events that happen to their Sims, such as death or pregnancies.
       Within the Sim community, there are members who have developed mods to customize the game further through aesthetics, new objects, or adding completely new assets to the game.
       From a cyberfeminist perspective, these social simulation games a player can choose to project their own body and engage with the fantasy world established by the game.
   The base game of these video games serve as foundation for players who create mods to expand on customization for their characters or virtual bodies. </p>

      <h2>MMO's</h2>
      <p>The abbreviation MMO refers to “Massively-Multiplayer-Online”, a genre of free-to-play online games that encourages players to roleplay a character with some features such as voice chat and discovering virtual spaces.
        MMOs differ from social simulation games like the Sims or Animal Crossing because the players must join a server or different worlds in order to socialize and interact with other players online.
        Both genres include customizing the appearance of the player’s character and creating their identity.
The concept is similar to building a character sheet like in the tabletop classic   <a class="inline_disabled" href="https://dnd.wizards.com/resources/character-sheets" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dungeons and Dragons, or D&D, </a>
 where the player utilizes a character sheet to customize an original character with unique personality traits and skills. MMOs range from more recent games like VR Chat to older games from the 2000s such as Runescape and Club Penguin.</p>
      <p><img src="/2022s/images/VRChat.jpg" alt="Cover image for VR Chat game displaying different styled cartoon characters on the left and right side" width="616" height="353" /></p>
      <h4>VR Chat</h4>
<p>Players can explore different worlds made by other players in VR Chat, and they can download other player’s character models.
  MMOs like VR Chat align with cyberfeminist theories of posthumanism because of the players’ ability to interact and socialize with other players.
  There are some worlds in VR chat that allow players to watch movies, play games live with other players, and worlds that explore virtual environments like beaches or shopping malls. </p>
      <h2>Online Safety </h2>
      <p> As the Internet became more accessible to households and online social platforms grew, laws on Internet safety were created in concern for unmonitored children and online predators.
        Online anonymity was not only an advantage for concealing one's true identity, it created a disadvantage for identifying predators and looking for a paper trail.
        Understanding cyber literacy and knowledge of privacy on the internet made it easy for predators to interact with minors and raised concern for parents who wish to know who their child is talking to.
        Virtual spaces that cater to children like Club Penguin, or community spaces that share fanworks have weak levels of precaution that can protect minors from explicit content.
      </p>

      <h2> Conclusion </h2>

      <p>
       Cyberfeminists postulated theories on the future relationship between cyber technology and the human experience of existing online.
       Now that the conversation of posthuman bodies is mainstream via MMOs and online communities, I believe cyberfeminists failed to account for the safety of minors and queer youth who seek community online.
       It is impossible to perfectly separate and protect minors from coming across explicit content and predators while they explore their identities online.
       The fantasy of existing as a different person through technology is a double-edged sword where virtual reality can provide a posthuman experience of customizing
       ones body, or mislead an individual into being lost in their own fantasy.

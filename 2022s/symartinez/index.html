      <p>
        Cyberfeminism has evolved since its manifestation in the 90s to early 2000s as technology advances for virtual spaces and online social communities that encompasses different areas of feminist critiques and theories.
        Cyberfeminist and transgender author, <a class="inline_disabled" href="http://switch.sjsu.edu/archive/nextswitch/switch_engine/front/front.php%3Fartc=225.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sandy Stone</a></span></p>, theorizes that virtual space allows internet users to participate in online communities that give them an agency over their bodies that will allow them to align with their identity.
        This “posthuman” body is beneficial for individuals in the queer community, especially trans bodies, to explore their identity meanwhile exist within a community under some form of anonymity. The goal of my paper is to provide a contemporary understanding of cyberfeminism through diverse examples of the “posthuman” in the modern day context.
      </p>

      <h2>
        Role Play
      </h2>
      <p>The practice of role-playing online has been around since the beginning of chat rooms and socializing online, and continues to exist in social media spaces like DeviantArt and Tumblr.
      The account that the online user owns is utilized entirely for the character they pretend to be and interact with other accounts acting under character.</p>
      <p>Individuals adopt an online avatar and meeting other people in a virtual space, along with the ability to control privacy through anonymity&nbsp;</p>

      <h2>Furries</h2>

      <p>The furry community is a strong example of an online roleplay community because online users adopt a &ldquo;fursona&rdquo;- an avatar that the user has created to represent their presence online.&nbsp;</span></p>

      <h2>Simulation role-playing games</h2>
      <p>An individual and virtual simulation that allows expression that relates to Stone&rsquo;s cyberfeminist theory on the &ldquo;posthuman&rdquo; experience.</p>
      <p>Games like Animal Crossing/Sims/Stardew Valley concentrate on the customization experience more so than the social aspect.</p>

      <h2>MMO's(VR Chat, Club Penguin, Runescape)</h2>
      <p>&ldquo;Massively-Multiplayer-Online&rdquo; free-to-play online games that allow players to roleplay online with voice chat and discovering virtual spaces.</p>
      <p><img src="images/VR_Chat.jpg" alt="Cover image for VR Chat. Image displays different styled cartoon characters on the left and right side." width="616" height="353" /></p>

      <h2>Dark Side </h2>
      <p> <li>of virtual spaces and how the younger generation can safely explore the new space. </li>
      <li>As the Internet became more accessible to households and online social platforms grew, the practice of online anonymity became a large issue for unmonitored children.</li>
      <li>Understanding cyber literacy and knowledge of privacy on the internet made it easy for predators to interact with minors and raised concern for parents who wanted to know who their child was talking to</li>
      <li>Early MMOs and forum spaces were not prepared for such dangerous situations since people were protected behind anonymity.</li>
      </p>

      <h2> Conclusion </h2>

      <p>
       Cyberfeminists postulated theories on the future relationship between technology and human identities that are relevant.
       Now that the conversation of “posthuman” bodies is normalized, I would suggest precautions so that younger generations can be safe exploring their identities online.

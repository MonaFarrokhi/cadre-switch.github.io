      <p>
	      As someone who’s born female, I know first hand, the struggle that women go through in order to be seen as human and achieve great things. 
	      We’re always told what we’re supposed to do, or told that we can’t do certain things because we’re not a man. For decades, women would always be 
	      controlled by a man, whether it was their father or husband. They’re forced to play the roles, regardless of whether or not they like it.
	      Since we created these stereotypes and situations, this is how the media began to portray us. For example, in older movies, females were usually 
	      seen as some sort of “prize” for the male characters, or written to be some helpless victim who doesn’t know how to do anything. We’re seen as 
	      nothing more than a wife or girlfriend to men. One that’s not meant to obey men, and constantly supposed to support them, serve them, look good 
	      for them, etc. I personally am a fan of breaking stereotypes and gender roles. I’m over being told who to be just because I was born female. 
	      (Disclaimer, I’m non-binary, but am female presenting, so this is how I get reated and seen.) For this text, I will write about how as the 
	      years have gone by, the way women are written in the media has changed. They’ve made progress from being someone who needs saving, so 
	      someone who can fight in wars and stand up for themselves. While this may seem great, and like a big step in the right direction, it’s 
	      still not enough. There’s still that need to add in a male to motivate the character or be their love interest.

      Intro
Have you ever felt pressured to act or look a certain way just because you are male or female? Were there sudden expectations for the kind of person you were expected to be? From the moment we were born, we were taught and raised with the morals and values of other people. Our parents guide us through life using the same knowledge that they used to raise us. Naturally they learned these things from their own parents, creating an ongoing cycle of these stereotypes being passed down from generation to generation. For centuries, these stereotypes have always existed in our lives even if we haven’t been made aware of them the whole time. In fact, each sex has their own set of stereotypes, differing from the opposing side. These stereotypes cause us to create somewhat inaccurate ideas in our heads of what other people are supposed to be like. Since these ideas were put into our minds when we were young, we tend to think certain ways, including when we make creative content and falsely present the opposite sex in media. Stereotypically in the media, women have been written and presented as frail, helpless, reliant on men, weak, argumentative, and sometimes dumb beings who are normally meant to be the love interest. Other than that, sometimes they don’t get any development in these stories and really only exist as an object or prize for the male characters to win or fight over. As years went by, many women have tried to rebel against those stereotypes and reject them. Some people heard them out and have began to write female characters differently, making them more independent, strong, and capable of speaking up for themselves. Media like this started to become so apparent that it began to normalize. However, just because we’ve made progress, that doesn’t mean it’s enough. From my perspective, I’ve noticed that even movies about a heroine as the main protagonist tend to have some lingering stereotypes or tropes. I myself am a non-binary and gender fluid person, however, I was born female and physically present myself as one sometimes. Because of this, I’m able to relate to hearing these stereotypes as well as analyze certain media and depict why some of these stories can still be viewed as stereotypical, making us realize we haven’t made as much progress as we think we have. The movies and shows I will be talking about are Twilight, Thor: Dark Moon, Iron Man 3, Mulan, WandaVision, and Steven Universe. Each of these movies reflects the stereotypical women in different ways, even with a few claiming to be more “progrThese are just the small steps.
Point 1- Twilight
For the first piece of media, I will go over the movie Twilight, based off the novel by Stephenie Meyer. One of the most important things to note is the main movie poster. The pose that they’re in is quite common for movie illustrations, even if they’re not romance stories. Bella is seen holding onto Edward’s chest, being embraced in his arms as if he’s protecting her. If you look more into it, we can see that his face is in the foreground, just barely covering hers. She belongs to him. She needs his help. She needs him. When “....Edward saves Bella from being crushed when a van careens toward her in the school parking lot. He tells her that he was right next to her when the van almost struck her, but she knows that he was across the parking lot and is baffled by his speed and strength” (Sparknotes). Immediately at the start of the story, Bella is in need of saving by a man. She never moved out of the way on her own, and instead was just seen as helpless and confused. Now, I’m not the smartest person, but even in highschool, I would have known to be more aware when I’m passing through a parking lot and run out of the way when I notice a car heading my way. Why did she just sit there and let it happen? Because Edward needed to be seen as the hero or perfect man, and to do that, Bella had to be put in danger. Later on, Bella is once again put in a difficult situation, perceived as merely a love interest who can’t seem to think for herself. “...four men begin to harass Bella, Edward roars up in his car and rescues her”(Sparknotes); Now to me, the way the script is, it objectifies her. She takes no action on her own, and is saved by the same heroic Edward. While yes, this is a romance story, they only started to interact after she was saved. There wasn’t much chemistry or talking between the two. She only became infatuated with him after rescuing her. I won’t go over the rest of the series, but one of the other well known plotlines of this story is that Edward and Jacob, the two main male protagonists, were fighting over Bella’s love. This also makes her the “prize” to be won. Scenarios like this, tend to paint false images in the minds of young adults, causing some women to think a man like Edward will come along to save them instead of trying to protect themselves. Later on, she turned good and joined the Avengers, surprisingly getting proper character development. She 
Point 2- Thor: Dark Moon (work on later)
Movie poster, holding onto a strong man, she’s holding onto him
She was put in danger
Taking a look at the movie poster for Thor: Dark Moon, we can see something rather familiar. The main characters, Jane and Thor, are posed similarly to how Bella and Edward were
Point 3- Iron Man 3 (work on later)
Was his assistant, turned love interest in the previous movies
Pepper had to be saved by him
Almost a breakthrough cause she stands up for herself and speaks her mind
(“We’re getting there” examples)
Point 4- Mulan (add more)
Overview of movie
She helped save China
Proved her worth despite being a female
Somewhat rejected the female stereotypes
There are some good and well written movies that exist and depict the female characters pretty well. One of my favorite movies are Disney’s Mulan. The movie is about a family in China living through a war. The father of the family is called to serve in the war again, but he’s much older compared to most of the other men in the city, meaning he’s more prone to getting hurt or killed. Because she’s worried about this Mulan tries to stick up for her father and ask them to make an exception. After being told no, she ends up joining the war in place of her father, but to do so she had to dress like a man. While training, she goes from having none of the skills needed to fight in a war to surpassing most of them. Later on after she gets separated from the rest of the army, she discovers what the Huns plans are, she goes back to town. Still on her own, she devises a plan to get rid of them
Point 5- Counter argument (add more)
She needed to disguise herself as a man to get recognition; was only seen as an equal when they believed she was a man
She did this to please her father
Now, we need to acknowledge some things that most people don’t pay attention to or won’t acknowledge. The recruiters tell her that it's not a woman’s place to talk out of line or speak for a man even if it is her father. After speaking with her dad, they remind him to keep her in check and that because she’s a loud woman who doesn’t seem to have manners, she’ll never get a husband. Naturally, this upsets her and she ends up making a big deal about it back at home. Both her parents end up telling her she needs to calm down, that she’s overreacting, that this is just the way that things are. Despite all this, she takes her father’s old gear and goes to join the army in his place, but…she joins as a man. This is the only way they’ll let her in and this was the main factor to them even acknowledging her. Before she posed as a male, they wouldn’t even bother to listen to a word she said. Now, with this movie, there’s a bit of a gray area because of the cultural aspect of things.
Point 6- WandaVision
Now let’s look at women who were written as heroes without having to pose as a male. In the Avengers series, the Scarlet Witch (Wanda) is written as one of the most powerful sorcerers in the world. In her Marvel debut, the Scarlet Witch had been locked up and experimented on because of how much of a danger she was seen as. At this point, she was a villain who was fighting against the Avengers. Eventually she was weaponized alongside her brother to fight against the team of Avengers. Using her abilities, she was strategic enough to control their minds and turn them against each other. There wasn’t a time where she needed saving, in fact she can be seen saving countless others. The premise of her spinoff series, WandaVision shows off her true powers, as she only continued to grow stronger. After the death of her lover, Vision, all she could think of was bringing him back. She wanted her happy ending, and to make this happen, she ended up controlling an entire city. One very popular story trope is someone trying to take over the whole world, and coming up with some grand scheme to do so. Normally, in these tropes, plans like this require a small army and powerful sources. Wanda didn’t need time, an army, or any resources. She simply relied on her own powers and drive to create her perfect ending. When the government outside of her range tried to stop her and force her to set free the town, she single handedly defended herself and fought back against a small army, armed with guns and tanks. She was confident and unafraid, something that she would’ve been shunned for if this took place decades ago. While yes, the government accused her of being a terrorist before and kidnapping a whole city, she was written incredibly well. At the end of the series, she even fought off against a dark witch who was almost as powerful as her. She won the battle and sealed away the spirit of that dark witch. In my eyes, she was portrayed as a strong character who was non-dependent on others for help. I also never saw her as being used as a “prize” for a male character to win over despite having her own love story. The love story was rather simple and never involved her partner having to step in and save her.
Point 7- Counterargument
To be quite honest, as much as I love Wanda, I do have a few issues with her storyline. With the new movie Doctor Strange: Multiverse of Madness coming out, it features Wanda, who is the main antagonist of the story. From a script writer’s perspective, I can see why they wrote her that way; They needed a powerful villain to work with. They likely figured, why not use the Scarlet Witch, someone who is literally written as one of the Strongest Avengers in the series. Overall, I don’t think they should have made her to be the villain. Yes, she’s this incredibly strong and rather clever woman, but this almost reinforces the stereotypes that women are very emotional and will cause arguments or disagreements because of them. In reality, all Wanda wanted was simply to be happy. She wanted what most people do, to marry someone and start a family. Instead, they used the trauma and emotions she went through to fuel her anger, forcing her to become a villain. If you really boil it down, we can see she was motivated by a man, in this case, the death of her lover. She for whatever reason, wasn’t written as being strong just for the sake of it. Beneath all these “feminist” movies, lies male motivation or drive somewhere underneath. Sometimes a woman can be powerful or evil just because she wants to. Why does there need to be a man involved?
Point 8- Steven Universe
Lastly, I will be analyzing the kid’s cartoon, Steven Universe. This show isn’t really aimed toward a specific gendered audience; If anything it’s a show I feel like people of all genders or backgrounds could enjoy. From my experience watching this, there exists a storyline or character that everyone can relate to. Since it is still a kids show, it has to entertain them and educate them. In this sense it still has messages about making friends, moral values, and contains many fight scenes; Themes that cater to both young boys and girls. The show has 5 scenes and one movie, with a long and detailed storyline. For the purpose of this topic, I will focus on how most of the female characters are portrayed throughout the series. The main female characters are an alien race from space known as “gems”. Each of these gems were created to become soldiers or commanders. Stereotypically, these roles would be written as male characters, due to the fact that they’re normally characterized as strong, leaders, and assertive individuals. I find this to be a good example of strong women in media compared to someone like Mulan or the Scarlet Witch. These characters were never motivated by a man; No romance, no male deaths, no man they had to impress. Another thing to note was that this show didn’t focus much on love stories with any character. None of them were “the prize” to be won by anyone. They were written to be soldiers, and that’s simply what they were animated as. Some of the characters were drawn bulked up with muscle, and most were seen commanding fleets or armies, while others were in the battlefield fighting off other threats. For this reason among many others, this has become one of my favorite shows.
Outro
We’re making progress, but its very little
Older generations still believe in stereotypes 
Why is it good to reject these stereotypes?
Restate/reword thesis(to be reworded): Women in the media have been used and cast as objects. Since then, we’ve started to treat them as the humans they are, even painting them as heroes. However, this small step isn’t enough.

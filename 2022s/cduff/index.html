      <h2>Abstract</h2>

      <p>
        As someone who’s born female, I know first hand, the struggle that women
        go through in order to be seen as human and achieve great things. We’re
        always told what we’re supposed to do, or told that we can’t do certain
        things because we’re not a man. For decades, women would always be
        controlled by a man, whether it was their father or husband. They’re
        forced to play the roles, regardless of whether or not they like it.
        Since we created these stereotypes and situations, this is how the media
        began to portray us. For example, in older movies, females were usually
        seen as some sort of “prize” for the male characters, or written to be
        some helpless victim who doesn’t know how to do anything. We’re seen as
        nothing more than a wife or girlfriend to men. One that’s not meant to
        obey men, and constantly supposed to support them, serve them, look good
        for them, etc. I personally am a fan of breaking stereotypes and gender
        roles. I’m over being told who to be just because I was born female.
        (Disclaimer, I’m non-binary, but am female presenting, so this is how I
        get reated and seen.) For this text, I will write about how as the years
        have gone by, the way women are written in the media has changed.
        They’ve made progress from being someone who needs saving, so someone
        who can fight in wars and stand up for themselves. While this may seem
        great, and like a big step in the right direction, it’s still not
        enough. There’s still that need to add in a male to motivate the
        character or be their love interest.

      <h2>From Objects to Heroes | Women in Media</h2>

      <!--       Example Paragraph with Hyperlink -->
      <p>
        Have you ever felt pressured to act or look a certain way just because
        you are male or female? Were there sudden expectations for the kind of
        person you were expected to be? From the moment we were born, we were
        taught and raised with the morals and values of other people. Our
        parents guide us through life using the same knowledge that they used to
        raise us. Naturally, they learned these things from their parents,
        creating an ongoing cycle of these stereotypes being passed down from
        generation to generation. For centuries, these stereotypes have always
        existed in our lives, even if we haven’t been made aware of them the
        whole time. In fact, each sex has its own set of stereotypes, differing
        from the opposing side. These stereotypes cause us to create somewhat
        inaccurate ideas in our heads of what other people are supposed to be
        like. Since these ideas were put into our minds when we were young, we
        tend to think in certain ways, including when we make creative content
        and falsely present the opposite sex in media. Stereotypically in the
        media, women have been written and presented as frail, helpless, reliant
        on men, weak, argumentative, and sometimes dumb beings who are normally
        meant to be the love interest. Other than that, sometimes they don’t get
        any development in these stories and really only exist as an object or a
        prize for the male characters to win or fight over. As years went by,
        many women have tried to rebel against those stereotypes and reject
        them. Some people heard them out and have began to write female
        characters differently, making them more independent, strong, and
        capable of speaking up for themselves. Media like this started to become
        so apparent that it began to normalize. However, just because we’ve made
        progress, that doesn’t mean it’s enough. From my perspective, I’ve
        noticed that even movies about a heroine as the main protagonist tend to
        have some lingering stereotypes or tropes. I myself am a non-binary and
        gender fluid person. However, I was born female and physically present
        myself as one sometimes. Because of this, I’m able to relate to hearing
        these stereotypes as well as analyze certain media and depict why some
        of these stories can still be viewed as stereotypical, making us realize
        we haven’t made as much progress as we think we have. The movies and
        shows I will be talking about are Twilight, Mulan, WandaVision, and
        Steven Universe. Each of these movies reflects the stereotypical women
        in different ways, even with a few claiming to be more “progressive.
        Realistically, these are just the small steps.
      </p>

      <p>
        For the first piece of media, I will go over the movie Twilight, based
        off the novel by Stephenie Meyer. One of the most important things to
        note is the main movie poster. The pose that they’re in is quite common
        for movie illustrations, even if they’re not romance stories. Bella is
        seen holding onto Edward’s chest, being embraced in his arms as if he’s
        protecting her. If you look more into it, we can see that his face is in
        the foreground, just barely covering hers. She belongs to him. She needs
        his help. She needs him. When “....Edward saves Bella from being crushed
        when a van careens toward her in the school parking lot. He tells her
        that he was right next to her when the van almost struck her, but she
        knows that he was across the parking lot and is baffled by his speed and
        strength” (Sparknotes). Immediately at the start of the story, Bella is
        in need of saving by a man. She never moved out of the way on her own,
        and instead was just seen as helpless and confused. Now, I’m not the
        smartest person, but even in highschool, I would have known to be more
        aware when I’m passing through a parking lot and run out of the way when
        I notice a car heading my way. Why did she just sit there and let it
        happen? Because Edward needed to be seen as the hero or perfect man, and
        to do that, Bella had to be put in danger. Later on, Bella is once again
        put in a difficult situation, perceived as merely a love interest who
        can’t seem to think for herself. “...four men begin to harass Bella,
        Edward roars up in his car and rescues her”(Sparknotes); Now to me, the
        way the script is, it objectifies her. She takes no action on her own,
        and is saved by the same heroic Edward. While yes, this is a romance
        story, they only started to interact after she was saved. There wasn’t
        much chemistry or talking between the two. She only became infatuated
        with him after rescuing her. I won’t go over the rest of the series, but
        one of the other well known plotlines of this story is that Edward and
        Jacob, the two main male protagonists, were fighting over Bella’s love.
        This also makes her the “prize” to be won. Scenarios like this, tend to
        paint false images in the minds of young adults, causing some women to
        think a man like Edward will come along to save them instead of trying
        to protect themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are some good and well written movies that exist and depict the
        female characters in a non stereotypical sense. One of my favorite
        movies are Disney’s Mulan. The movie is about a family in China living
        through a war. The father of the family is called to serve in the war
        again, but he’s much older compared to most of the other men in the
        city, meaning he’s more prone to getting hurt or killed. Because she’s
        worried about this Mulan tries to stick up for her father and ask them
        to make an exception. After being told no, she ends up joining the war
        in place of her father, but to do so she had to dress like a man. While
        training, she goes from having none of the skills needed to fight in a
        war to surpassing most of them. Later on after she gets separated from
        the rest of the army, she discovers what the Huns plans are, she goes
        back to town. She tried to tell some of the other soldiers in the area,
        but they believed she was being out of line and refused to listen to the
        word of a woman. Still on her own, she devises a plan to get rid of them
        and sneaks off. Some of the other soldiers find her and agree to help
        her because despite being a woman, they acknowledged that she was just
        as strong and courageous. With her strategies, bravery, and
        determination, Mulan and the other soldiers end up saving China.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now, we need to acknowledge some things that most people don’t pay
        attention to or won’t acknowledge. The recruiters tell her that it's not
        a woman’s place to talk out of line or speak for a man even if it is her
        father. After speaking with her dad, they remind him to keep her in
        check and that because she’s a loud woman who doesn’t seem to have
        manners, she’ll never get a husband. Naturally, this upsets her and she
        ends up making a big deal about it back at home. Both her parents end up
        telling her she needs to calm down, that she’s overreacting, that this
        is just the way that things are. Despite all this, she takes her
        father’s old gear and goes to join the army in his place, but…she joins
        as a man. This is the only way they’ll let her in and this was the main
        factor to them even acknowledging her. Before she posed as a male, they
        wouldn’t even bother to listen to a word she said. Now, with this movie,
        there’s a bit of a gray area because of the cultural aspect of things.
        Setting this aside, one of the most common stereotypes of women are that
        they’re loud, like to cause arguments, and only speak when spoken to.
        Since this was “just how things were”, she gets reminded of her place.
        When she finally reaches the army campsites, all the other men talk to
        her like it’s no big deal, but that’s only because they believe that
        she’s actually a man. This goes on for quite a bit up until they find
        out who she really is. Once they do, they leave her at the side of a
        mountain and tell her to go home because the battlefield is no place for
        a woman. Towards the end of the movie, after they save China, she goes
        back home to see her family. The first person she goes to see is her
        father, someone who she’s been aiming to please.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now let’s look at women who were written as heroes without having to
        pose as a male. In the Avengers series, the Scarlet Witch (Wanda) is
        written as one of the most powerful sorcerers in the world. In her
        Marvel debut, the Scarlet Witch had been locked up and experimented on
        because of how much of a danger she was seen as. At this point, she was
        a villain who was fighting against the Avengers. Eventually she was
        weaponized alongside her brother to fight against the team of Avengers.
        Using her abilities, she was strategic enough to control their minds and
        turn them against each other. Later on, she turned good and joined the
        Avengers, surprisingly getting proper character development. Her powers
        only continued to grow stronger, and many even faced off with Thanos,
        one of the biggest threats in the series, all by herself. There weren’t
        many times where she needed saving, in fact she can be seen saving
        countless others. The premise of her spinoff series, WandaVision shows
        off her true powers, as she only continued to grow stronger. After the
        death of her lover, Vision, all she could think of was bringing him
        back. She wanted her happy ending, and to make this happen, she ended up
        controlling an entire city. One very popular story trope is someone
        trying to take over the whole world, and coming up with some grand
        scheme to do so. Normally, in these tropes, plans like this require a
        small army and powerful sources. Wanda didn’t need time, an army, or any
        resources. She simply relied on her own powers and drive to create her
        perfect ending. When the government outside of her range tried to stop
        her and force her to set free the town, she single handedly defended
        herself and fought back against a small army, armed with guns and tanks.
        She was confident and unafraid, something that she would’ve been shunned
        for if this took place decades ago. Although, the government accused her
        of being a terrorist before and kidnapping a whole city, she was written
        incredibly well. At the end of the series, she even fought off against a
        dark witch who was almost as powerful as her. She won the battle and
        sealed away the spirit of that dark witch. In my eyes, she was portrayed
        as a strong character who was non-dependent on others for help. I also
        never saw her as being used as a “prize” for a male character to win
        over despite having her own love story. The love story was rather simple
        and never involved her partner having to step in and save her.
      </p>
      <p>
        To be quite honest, as much as I love Wanda, I do have a few issues with
        her storyline. With the new movie Doctor Strange: Multiverse of Madness
        coming out, it features Wanda, who is the main antagonist of the story.
        From a script writer’s perspective, I can see why they wrote her that
        way; They needed a powerful villain to work with. They likely figured,
        why not use the Scarlet Witch, someone who is literally written as one
        of the Strongest Avengers in the series. Overall, I don’t think they
        should have made her to be the villain. Yes, she’s this incredibly
        strong and rather clever woman, but this almost reinforces the
        stereotypes that women are very emotional and will cause arguments or
        disagreements because of them. In reality, all Wanda wanted was simply
        to be happy. She wanted what most people do, to marry someone and start
        a family. Instead, they used the trauma and emotions she went through to
        fuel her anger, forcing her to become a villain. If you really boil it
        down, we can see she was motivated by a man, in this case, the death of
        her lover. She wasn’t written to be strong because of her character and
        personality. Beneath all these “feminist” movies, lies male motivation
        or drive somewhere underneath. Sometimes a woman can be powerful or evil
        just because she wants to. Why does there need to be a man involved?
      </p>
      <p>
        Lastly, I will be analyzing the kid’s cartoon, Steven Universe. This
        show isn’t really aimed toward a specific gendered audience; If anything
        it’s a show I feel like people of all genders or backgrounds could
        enjoy. From my experience watching this, there exists a storyline or
        character that everyone can relate to. Since it is still a kids show, it
        has to entertain them and educate them. In this sense it still has
        messages about making friends, moral values, and contains many fight
        scenes; Themes that cater to both young boys and girls. The show has 5
        scenes and one movie, with a long and detailed storyline. For the
        purpose of this topic, I will focus on how most of the female characters
        are portrayed throughout the series. The main female characters are an
        alien race from space known as “gems”. Each of these gems were created
        to become soldiers or commanders. Stereotypically, these roles would be
        written as male characters, due to the fact that they’re normally
        characterized as strong, leaders, and assertive individuals. I find this
        to be a good example of strong women in media compared to someone like
        Mulan or the Scarlet Witch. These characters were never motivated by a
        man; No romance, no male deaths, no man they had to impress. Another
        thing to note was that this show didn’t focus much on love stories with
        any character. None of them were “the prize” to be won by anyone. They
        were written to be soldiers, and that’s simply what they were animated
        as. Some of the characters were drawn bulked up with muscle, and most
        were seen commanding fleets or armies, while others were in the
        battlefield fighting off other threats. For this reason among many
        others, this has become one of my favorite shows.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since the media has been created, many people have been writing
        different stories, each with different perspectives. One thing that
        still tends to remain the same is the way they portray certain genders.
        Gender culture has been framed the way it is because of the stereotypes
        that we’ve constructed them, thus forming our sexist society. As the
        years have gone by, women have banded together to raise their voice and
        rebel against these stereotypes. They’re spreading the messages that we
        are not bound by the things that we were taught. We’re allowed to be
        whoever we are. We’re allowed to question society and others. We’re more
        than what the media portrays us to be. Present day media such as Mulan,
        WandaVision, and Steven Universe are examples of what women are truly
        capable of. Women can be portrayed as strong, brave, courageous, smart,
        and unafraid to speak their minds. We’ve began to paint women as more
        than just objects, heroes in fact, but this still isn’t enough. The
        stereotypes, sexism, and expectations still exist in the world, and its
        something we should continue to question and go against.

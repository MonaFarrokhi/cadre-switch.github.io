	<h2>Abstract</h2>
	    <p>This paper discuss the relationship between video games platforms and new media art.
		    Even though video games have risen in popularity and being a great part of modern culture, 
		    they are still struggling to be recognized as an art form. However, with their artistic values
		    in interactive experiences and appealing visual art, video games have proved the world that it is, 
		    indeed, a form of art. The paper also talks about the two games: Another world (1991) and The Path (2009), 
		    which are has officially entered the realm of video game arts, according to the Museum of Modern Art (MOMA). </p>

	    <p style="margin-left: 40px">Nowadays, video games are a great part of our culture. Just like any other visual expression, 
		    video game art can provoke emotions, make us think and surprise us with new ideas,
		    or just make us smile. In fact, video games have been in the art world since the beginning of their creation,
		    and many of their creators are artists who made great works based on this medium.
		    Even though video games are medium that includes many forms of artistic expression with their visual
		    appeal and creative interactivity, they are still struggling to be recognized as a great potential art form.
		    This paper will look at the debate on video games as an art form that has been ongoing for a long time and 
		    how their evolution and artistic values are enough to prove that it is a form of art.</p>
	    
	    <p style="margin-left: 40px"> In the early days, video games were only regarded as digitized games and nothing more
		    than that. Most of them were played on large arcade machines and home consoles with 2D graphics and simple
		    sounds. This was mainly attributed to the fact that video games, designated for a specific group, were 
		    particularly for play and youthful competition (Deardorff). However, as Deardorff ascertains, video games 
		    are now perceived more significantly over time since they have begun to shift in purpose and use. 
		    The evolution of video games, which can be primarily ascribed to technological advancements, has made them
		    more artistic than ever by expanding the tools and mediums that artists can use to express ideas, tell
		    stories and create their own art. The relationship between art and game is grounded on the fact that games 
		    are a collision of art and science. According to Roger Ebert, "One obvious difference between art and games
		    is that you can win a game. It has rules, points, objectives, and an outcome…" (Deardorff). However,
		    the same aspects that Ebert claims distinguish games from art when keenly looked into are the similarities
		    between the two. One of those aspects is that video games are governed by rules. Moreover, as Chris Melissionos 
		    confirms, video games are characterized by various art mediums, including traditional artistic expression, 
		    sculpture in different 3D modeling, narrative arcs, illustrations, and dynamic music. This relationship between 
		    games and art is a significant basis for the argument for considering video games as forms of art.</p>
	    <p style="margin-left: 40px">Another way of assessing if video games should be considered forms of art is by looking at
		    their artistic values. Such values are important because they help identify the connection between various different 
		    video games with art in general. An artistic approach answers the questions of how games are created and how the
		    creators communicate their ideas to players. One of the great examples of an art game is Another world, a cinematic
		    platformer game published in 1991 by Delphine Software and is the brainchild of French graphic designer and programmer Eric Chahi.
		    The game tells a story of Lester Knight Chaykin, a young scientist who accidentally falls into a parallel universe and tries to 
		    return home. In this game, the main character jumps and runs from platform to platform to avoid obstacles and keep moving forward.
		    The artistic values of the Another World game are based on its groundbreaking graphics and story. It has been praised for its unique 
		    atmosphere and minimalist aesthetic. The most characteristic element of this game is its ambiance, which includes a dark atmosphere,
		    audio effects, and background music that gives players a very different feeling from other games at that time. In addition, the behavior 
		    of the two players involved in the game confirms this artistic value. As far as time is concerned, this video game is not limited to a 
		    specific period of time. Instead, "The game ends if either Lester or his alien friend is shot" (Antonelli). The space of the game is restricted 
		    to the scores of the two players and the energy gauge, and as such, there is no display of the external world.</p>

	       <p style="margin-left: 40px">Another video game that can be analyzed from an artistic viewpoint is The Path, released in 2009 by Tale of Tales. 
		       It is a minimalist exploration horror game that tells its story entirely through visual aesthetics — there are no spoken or written 
		       words throughout the entire experience. In the game, players control a young girl traveling through a forest to visit her grandmother's house;
		       along the way she encounters several moral choices that affect both her journey through the woods and her ultimate destination. The Path 
		       has been described as "a game about ethics" that explores difficult decisions involving personal sacrifice as well as more everyday decisions
		       such as choosing between helping friends and protecting oneself from danger. It goes against traditional video game mechanics as it challenges
		       the audience's assumptions about storytelling in games.<p>

	    <p style="margin-left: 40px">Nevertheless, it is important to note that people have differing opinions about video games and their inclusion as forms of art. 
		    One common belief is that, unlike art and its forms, which revolve around taste and culture, video games are a source of entertainment and they are
		    more about interaction with other characters in the game rather than creating something unique as it happens through painting or photography. This is true,
		    especially when looking at an angle that considers video games as meant mainly to address the needs of teenagers and young people at large. However, 
		    being a source of entertainment and focusing on the young generations does not disqualify video games from being forms of art. There is nothing wrong with
		    using the various art forms to target different audiences. Furthermore, entertainment is a remarkable part of art and video games can be, and frequently are,
		    just as thought-provoking, moving, and sophisticated as any other form of art. What is critical is that video games use the same kind of techniques that great
		    works of art use, making them just a different form of art addressing a specific audience in a different dimension.</p>
	    <p style="margin-left: 40px">I believe that video games have clearly become ingrained in modern culture and that with technological advancements, they offer
		    a rich tapestry of experiences and emotions that rival those of other media. Despite the fact that video games are still battling for recognition as 
		    a major potential art form, their growth and artistic values are sufficient to demonstrate that they are works of art. The struggle of officially making 
		    video games forms of art is almost coming to an end. According to the Museum of Modern Art (MOMA), video games are officially art (Eveleth). The museum
		    already has 14 video games as part of its permanent collection. In a nutshell, video games are indeed a form of art.</p>

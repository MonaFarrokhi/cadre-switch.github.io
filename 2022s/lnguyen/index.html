    <p><strong>1. Introduction:</strong><span style="font-weight: 500;">
          Nowadays, video games are a great part of our culture. Just like any other visual expression, video game art
          can provoke emotions, make us think and surprise us with new ideas or just make us smile. Despite the fact
          that video games have been in the art world since the beginning of their creation and many of their creators
          are artists who made great works on the basis of this medium, video game art is still struggling to be
	    recognized as a great potential art form.&nbsp;</span></p>
  </ol>
  <ul>
    <p><strong>2. Body:</strong><span style="font-weight: 500;">
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li style="font-weight: 500;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 500;">In the early days, video games were
        played on large arcade machines and home consoles with 2D graphics and simple sounds. Over time, technology has
        enabled greater detail in-game environments, characters, and their interactions with each other. Video games
        also have begun to shift in purpose and use. Besides entertainment, video games nowadays focus on artistic
        elements such as narrative, music, and graphic design.</span></li>
    <li style="font-weight: 500;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 500;">Video games can be considered a branch
        of Digital Art. It is a subject that investigates connections between video games and art, such as theory and
        aesthetics. Video games include many different types of art forms such as drawing, sculpting, 3D modeling,
        illustration, animation, dynamic music, etc. Moreover, artists use these new tools to express ideas, tell
        stories and create their own art within popular games.</span></li>
    <li style="font-weight: 500;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 500;">Examples of some video game art and
        their artistic value:</span></li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li style="font-weight: 500;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 500;">A good example of an art game is
        Another world (1991). Another World is a cinematic platformer game published in 1991 by Delphine Software and is
        the brainchild of French graphic designer and programmer Eric Chahi. In this game, the main character jumps and
        runs from platform to platform to avoid obstacles and keep moving forward. With its groundbreaking use of
        advanced effects in sound and editing as well as graphics, the game has been acclaimed for its unique atmosphere
        and minimalist aesthetic.</span></li>
    <li style="font-weight: 500;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 500;">Another example is The Path, released
        in 2009 by the independent game company Tale of Tales. This game uses gothic horror to retell a classic fairy
        tale about growing up. The Path also goes against traditional video game mechanics as it regularly takes control
        of the character from the player, giving it a voyeuristic pace of play. The ethereal artistic design and
        attention to detail add to the mood, creating a beautiful setting.</span></li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li style="font-weight: 500;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 500;">Against argument:&nbsp; There are many
        arguments against the gaming industry as an art form. According to Roger Ebert and others, video games cannot be
        art because they lack the taste and culture required for art. They think video games are a great source of
        entertainment but don't consider video games as art. Video games are more about interaction with other
        characters in the game rather than creating something unique as it happens through painting or
        photography.</span></li>
    <li style="font-weight: 500;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 500;">Supporting 1: As the debate around
        whether or not video games can be considered "high art" continues to rage, there are signs that video games are
        potentially modern art:</span></li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li style="font-weight: 500;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 500;">Video games combine visual art with
        interactive experiences</span></li>
    <li style="font-weight: 500;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 500;">Video games can be, and frequently are,
        just as thought-provoking, moving, and sophisticated as any other form of art.</span></li>
    <li style="font-weight: 500;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 500;">Video games also offer a rich tapestry
        of experiences and emotions that rival those of other media.</span></li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li style="font-weight: 500;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 500;">Supporting 2: Video games are
        officially art. The Museum of Modern Art has officially added video games to its collection. "The Museum of
        Modern Art bought 14 video games last week to add to its permanent collection&mdash;making video games not just
        interesting anthropological artifacts but also a form of art."</span></li>
  </ul>
  <ol>
   <p><strong>3. Conclusion:</strong><span style="font-weight: 500;"> I believe
        that video games are, indeed, a form of art. The evolution of video games has created a new media that combines
        visual art with interactive experiences. Video games have clearly become </span><span
        style="font-weight: 500;">ingrainedengrained</span><span style="font-weight: 500;"> in modern culture, and with
        the technological advances made are well on their way to being considered modern art.</span></p>

	    <p style="margin-left: 40px">Nowadays, video games are a great part of our culture. Just like any other visual expression, 
		    video game art can provoke emotions, make us think and surprise us with new ideas,
		    or just make us smile. In fact, video games have been in the art world since the beginning of their creation,
		    and many of their creators are artists who made great works based on this medium.
		    Even though video games are medium that includes many forms of artistic expression with their visual
		    appeal and creative interactivity, they are still struggling to be recognized as a great potential art form.
		    This paper will look at the debate on video games as an art form that has been ongoing for a long time and 
		    how their evolution and artistic values are enough to prove that it is a form of art.</p>

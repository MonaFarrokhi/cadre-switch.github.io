      <p>
        Identifying art is one way to interpret its meaning and intentions, but what happens if Post-Internet art becomes too complex to understand when your viewer is somehow connected to an artist’s work. Is it possible to lose your artist’s touch or an accidental collaboration waiting to reform against traditional art?
Post-Internet engages the viewers participating and willing to become part of the art without being directly interesting in their work. Sure images and descriptions would suffice, but I want to dig deeper into the meaning.

II. Body Paragraph 1

 	Post-Internet art one of characteristics is an Original-Copy Relationship. As HiSour stated in their article, “Post-internet redefines the original-copy relationship. It is primarily based on reworking what is available on the Internet.” (HiSoUR). That is why I wanted to tackle the problem of whether this movement was intentionally created because of the indirect relationship with the viewers. This has create an online virality caused a form of viewership and a mode of display. Another factor is the ability to be versatile when presenting the artwork. Post-Internet art can be displayed in online and offline medium formats. 
<br>
   C. How is it portrayed in current trends?

III. Body Paragraph 2
   A. Aesthetic Era and Media Narratives

   B. Compare old and current artists’ works

IV. Body Paragraph 3
   A. Finding inspired artworks from Pinterest and Tumblr

<br>
V. Body Paragraph 4
   A. Prosumption: focusing more on “Found” more than “Created”
Prosumption is…
   B. Is it a parody or a rebellious statement about the internet?
   C. Explaining Authorship
<br>
VI. Body Paragraph 5
   The audience accidentally collaborated with the artists because of their strong influence on how the artwork was made. According to Nina Blumberg, “Sean Fader, Pontes’s projects rely on viewer interaction and engagement for their success. However, the artist places a strong emphasis on studying the social and psychological motivations of her audience through her work.”(Blumberg). Audience’s role in art is a passive participation  with the artist in making the art a success. Without any likes or engagement from the audience, then there is no reason for displaying art in the first place. The audience brings art attention, therefore visual representations of Post-Internet art wouldn’t exist without the viewership.

<br>
VII. Body Paragraph 6
   A. What is Post-Internet identity and role in the art realm?
   B. Theories behind the term and concept of mainstream media
   C. How to identify a Post-Internet art?
Looking for clues and common patterns that represent Post-Internet art
<br>
VIII. Conclusion
  
In conclusion, Post-Internet art is the rebel of internet art because it opposes the ideas of the current internet. When you see Post-Internet…Viewers digitally and socially interacted in internet culture and therefore participated in helping the artist’s creative process. ​​Either way, some Post-Internet artists have encountered a digital experience and expressed it based on intuition and an aesthetic feeling.

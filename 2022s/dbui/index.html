	    Intro
	    </h1>
	    <p>
Nanotechnology, also known as nanotech, is the method of manipulating matter in order to make certain materials. Currently, nanotech is one of the main tools in creating new structures for economic use. It has been used in scientific practices for the most part. A good example on how nanotech is used is measuring how wide a red blood cell can be, but there have been times when nanotech has been used in art practice as well. An example of nanotech in an art practice would be statues that were made through nanotechnology in order to make its structure. Nanotech has been used and portrayed in many different ways, but it is important to know where nanotech originally came from.  
      </p> 
	  
	    <h1>
	    The concept of Nanotech
	    </h1> 
	    
	    <p>
	    The concept of nanotech started in the late 1950s when the American Physicist Richard Feynman introduced it in the annual meeting of the American Physical Society. Before he introduced the topic, he then made a hypothesis which stated, “Why can’t we write the entire 24 volumes of the Encyclopedia Britannica on the head of a pin?” (NIH, 2020). In doing so, he then made the solution of having machines on a molecular level to execute the deed rather than manually write it. He was considered the father of nanotech. Nanotechnology became an official term in the 1970s by Norio Taniguchi to describe a semiconductor to measure the units of a nanometer. 
	    </p>
	    
	    <h1>
	    Nanotech portrayed differently
	    </h1>
	      <p>
	    As time went by, nanotechnology was portrayed very differently than what it was intended for. Although many modern media interprets nanotech differently from one another, they all have the similarities of utilizing it in a scientific practice setting. In a lot of modern films, whenever nanotech is featured or mentioned, they briefly explain how it is mainly used and not what it is from their own point of view. In reality, a lot of scientific practices of nanotech are used for beneficial purposes. Compared to modern entertainment, it is shown to be unrealistic to how they use nanotech rather than how it is mainly used on a day to day basis.


	    </p>
	      <p>
	    A good example of how nanotech is used in real life scenarios is public labs researching exoskeletons. An exoskeleton is an external skeleton that is used to support one's body such as animals or bodysuits. The use of an exoskeleton is very similar to the use of how turtles use their shells for protecting themselves from predators. Exoskeletons made for people are examples of nanotech being used in order to make these tools for the greater future. In comparison, there have been many situations where nanotechnology is portrayed differently than how it is used now. A great example of this is the Disney Pixar film, Big Hero 6. 

	    </p>
	    
	    <h1>
	    Nanotech in animated films
	    </h1>
	      <p>
	    Throughout the animated film, the theme that is shown very often is having nanotechnology to define the world and people of the characters. Nanotech, to be specific, is shown in many instances from laser weapons and armor, but a good example of how this movie portrays nanotechnology is a bundle of machines known as microbots. In the film, microbots are tiny robots that when grouped together can make an amalgamation of structures. These structures can be very diverse, from a staircase to a giant hand. In a way, this is similar to how nanotechnology is in reality. Using small machines in order to make certain materials or structures for the greater future. The only difference from what is shown in the film to reality is that the microbots are more physical than how nanotechnology actually is. Similar to how Big Hero 6 uses nanotech to make structures, in reality, there have been instances where nanotech has been used to make structures.

	    Nanotech in reality
	    </h1>
	      <p>
	    The times in which nanotech has been used to make structures is when making statues for universities. The best example that fits this is the collection of statues called “Spannungsfeld” that were found in the University of Minnesota. These statues are placed outside of the physics and nanotechnology building on the twin cities campus. Spannungsfeld was inspired by the view of the human body through the lens of physics and nanotechnology (James Schaak, 2021) . The intention for these statues was to define the concept of tension between polar opposites in the same plane in which one cannot live without the support of another from this art installation. Speaking of art, there have been times in which nanotechnology has been used in art practices. This can be seen from the Fetter Nanoscience and Art Museum, located in BINA. Within this museum, the theme of nanotechnology combined with art makes fascinating results. The art practice consisted of using tools of nanotech and implementing it in the installations. This forms a new creative mindset in which artists and scientists make results that were never to be seen before. Tal Yizrael, the curator of the museum, stated that, “when people from different creative disciplines meet they find a new way of thinning” (Margrit, 2021). With this intention, the combination of art and science can lead to many possibilities that the future can hold.

	    Comparison
	    </h1>
	      <p>
	    When comparing how nanotechnology is portrayed in modern entertainment to how it is actually used, there are little similarities with each other. The only difference that modern entertainment differs from reality is how futuristic it wants nanotechnology to be. As of right now, modern entertainment views nanotechnology as futuristic as it possibly can be, such as having flying cars or mini-robots making shapes from the waves in your mind. Although that is not realistic in today’s standards, it is not far off in how nanotech is used in modern day practice. We can use nanotechnology to examine x-rays, cell structure, and even brain waves. It just needs to be more developed as time goes by. 

	    </p>
	    
	    <h1>
	    Conclusion
	    </h1>
	      <p>
	    In general, nanotechnology is used differently than how it is portrayed in modern media. The entertainment world sees nanotechnology with the mindset of having super unrealistic and futuristic views. While in reality, nanotech is used to examine and measure certain units in practice. Although how we use nanotech is very different compared to those in entertainment, it is not far off as it gets developed more in the future. As time goes by, we will eventually get our own version of nanotech as movies believe.

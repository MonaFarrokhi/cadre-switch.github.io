<h6><strong>Introduction</strong></h6>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fourth Wave Feminism has a significant impact on contemporary media and culture due to the ideals and goals demonstrated by the Fourth Wave. This is important because it shows how Postfeminism has evolved since the impact of the Third Wave and the technological change. This is seen in various media such as film, music, television, literature, art, and social media. Since Third Wave Feminism in the late 2000s, feminism has drastically changed from the &ldquo;punk-rock&rdquo; attitude that defined that era. The goals of the Fourth Wave are to establish power and to give a voice to women. The research provided is meant to demonstrate the power that Fourth Wave Feminism has on culture and media.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h6><strong>Social Media</strong></h6>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One powerful tool that the Fourth Wave has is social media. Social media are networking platforms where people can create or share content on the internet. Feminism has a strong connection with social media as it is not only used mostly by women, but it also gives allows them to speak up about certain issues they are facing. An online movement named, </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MeToo_movement#2017_(Alyssa_Milano)"><span style="font-weight: 400;">MeToo</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, is an example of women using social media as a tool. The movement was founded by social activist, </span><a href="https://metoomvmt.org/get-to-know-us/tarana-burke-founder/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tarana Burke</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, who used MySpace to speak about her sexual abuse experiences growing up. This would cause a resurgence in 2015 by Italian model, Ambra Gutierrez who would </span><a href="https://www.cnnphilippines.com/life/culture/2020/9/24/ambra-gutierrez-interview-metoo.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">speak up</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on social media about her modeling director, Harvey Weinstein sexually assaulting the model. This would cause public outrage towards Weinstein and create the famous Twitter hashtag, &ldquo;#MeToo&rdquo;, based on the original post from Burke in 2006. Since 2021, the movement has been used by celebrities and non-celebrity personalities on social media. The importance of MeToo relies on giving power to women. Originally, women in work environments were silenced by not having a voice. Society has learned to adapt to making these issues of sexual harassment important due to the MeToo movement. This movement is one of the most impactful movements of Fourth Wave Feminism.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Furthermore, there are many scientific studies and research that provide additional supporting evidence on women and social media. Social media is mostly used by females, with the female demographic rising due to the effects of the MeToo movement. </span><a href="https://www.cfr.org/blog/how-social-media-has-reshaped-feminism"><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to statistical research on women using social media</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, they state that women are underrepresented in traditional media (television, movies, etc). Only 38% of women are represented in traditional media, compared to social media, </span><a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/471345/us-adults-who-use-social-networks-gender/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">where they are represented by a staggering 78%</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This is due to women being able to express themselves on social media. A large percentage of women joined social media after the MeToo movement was trending and gave women the opportunity to express themselves. This is important because social media is probably the most powerful tool a woman can have in today&rsquo;s society.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">While there are many examples of the MeToo movement being used, celebrities are just one of the many examples of women who use the movement to bring awareness of sexual abuse in an industry. Stefani Germanotta, known by her stage name, </span><a href="https://www.glamour.com/story/lady-gaga-opened-up-about-becoming-pregnant-after-a-sexual-assault"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lady Gaga spoke up about being pregnant due to her sexual abuse from her former producer</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Gaga in an Instagram post that she was sexually assaulted when she was 19 years old. She elaborates on this stating that she wasn&rsquo;t able to speak up about the issue until she left the music industry that which she was involved. Despite leaving the industry she was working with, she still faced traumatization from the experience and had a hard time speaking up about it. &ldquo;I understand this #MeToo movement. I understand that some people feel comfortable with this, and I do not. I do not ever want to face that person again. This system is so abusive and so dangerous&rdquo;, Gaga states in an Instagram post. She uses social media (and the MeToo movement despite being uncomfortable with it) to express her sexual abuse experience. Since then she has created music and a tv show regarding her experiences. Since then she has started to have regained power in herself and confidence in who she wants to be going forward. Gaga has used social media to regain her power and to speak up about her sexual abuse claims which follow the goals of the MeToo movement. This in turn is an example of how powerful Feminism has on social media.&nbsp;</span></p>

<h4><em><span>Krista Suh, Jayna Zweiman</span>. The Pussyhat Project. 2016.&nbsp;</em></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Feminism has also impacted the world of Art and Design with movements with media that use imagery of the female body to demonstrate the power of women. One such example of this is the </span><a href="https://www.pussyhatproject.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pussyhat project in 2016</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The movement was created to bring awareness to women&rsquo;s issues through education and art. They achieved this by wearing knitted hats that resemble the female genitalia. The movement started as a peaceful protest in retaliation toward former President Trump&rsquo;s comments about &ldquo;</span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/08/us/donald-trump-tape-transcript.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">grabbing women by the pussy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">&rdquo;. His comments caused a huge uproar in the female community and sparked the goal for the Women&rsquo;s March in 2017. During this march, two women named Krista Suh and Jayna Zweiman wanted to stand out from the crowd and show their presence there. What they decided to do was created hand-knitted hats in the shape of a vagina to show their presence at the march. This caused attendees and crafters from all over the world to create hats that would help spread this message. This would create the Pussyhat project. The movement that uses these hand-crafted hats has become a symbol for feministic art and is possibly one of the most popular examples of Postermodernistic art. The importance of this project is to demonstrate the power of feminism through these pink-colored hats.&nbsp;</span></p>

<h4><i>Cassie Mcquarter. BLACK ROOM. 2017</i></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another feministic artwork can be seen in the digital artwork,</span><a href="http://www.cassiemcquater.com/blackroom.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> BLACK ROOM created by artist Cassie Mcquarter</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Mcquarter wanted to create a game that was targeted toward spreading the ideology of women in video games. What she created was a video game that explores sprites, artworks, and other various game assets that only contain women or women-related items. The game is supposed to be a combination of surrealism and feminism in which she achieves this with the feministic fantasy worlds she creates. This is an example of a digital media artist who is creating video games to express ideals of Feminism. Her game is meant to demonstrate that not every woman is not just sex appeal for men, they are also badass warriors that can also be just as powerful as men.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p2><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img src="https://www.creativeboom.com/uploads/articles/ec/ec59beb51695f9bf0b717bf964b6500873e657e5_1620.jpg" alt="Kumikaho Oshima. Untitled. 2019" width="911" height="884" /></span></p2>
<h4><i>Kumikaho Oshima. Untilted. 2019</i></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Furthermore, another impactful artist on the rise in the traditional art world is Japanese artist, </span><a href="https://www.creativeboom.com/inspiration/kumikaho-oshimas-paintings-of-barbie-dolls-highlight-the-revolution-of-japanese-women/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kumikaho Oshima, and her Barbie doll artworks</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Her paintings consist of Barbie dolls behind US dollar bills which are meant to represent the superficial idea of women&rsquo;s bodies being for sale. These dolls are portrayed in sexual positions while they are completely nude. The paintings are highly photorealistic and have strong lighting on the dolls. This in combination with the meaning of the paintings is meant to depict the erotic representation of females. Oshima created these paintings to change the public image of Japanese women&rsquo;s morals and desires. In Japan, women view money as a sign of power. These paintings are meant to be a reaction to those ideals. These paintings are impactful on culture and media because they represent the female figure in an abstract-representational manner. This along with the meaning of the painting shows that feministic art has significance in media and culture.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h6><strong>Music</strong><strong></strong></h6>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The music industry also has an immense feminist influence on culture and media. A few musicians who use feminism in their music are Lady Gaga (mentioned earlier), Lana Del Rey, and Beyonce. These musicians will have a close analysis of how their songs impacted Fourth Wave Feminism, culture, and media.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p2><span style="font-weight: 400;"><iframe title="YouTube video player" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GpCnunV8hdk" width="560" height="315" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"></iframe></span></p2>
<h4><i>Lana Del Rey. This Is What Makes Us Girls. 2012</i></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lana Del Rey is a musician who rose to fame in 2011 with her song, &ldquo;Video Games&rdquo; being viral that year. Since then she has made various social media posts and songs that explore different issues of feminism. </span><a href="https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1597021/FULLTEXT02"><span style="font-weight: 400;">An example of this is her social media post on Instagram </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">where she says, &ldquo;While Cardi B, Arianna, Doja Cat, Niki Minaj, Kehlani and Beyonce have had number ones with songs about being sexy, no clothes, fucking, embodied, cheating, etc - can I please go back to singing about being embodied, feeling beautiful by being in love even if the relationshi[pis not perfect, or dance for money - or what I want- without being crucified or maybe that I&rsquo;m glamorizing abuse?????&rdquo; She furthers this post by expressing her frustrations with the music industry destroying the female image with their exaggerations and lies about womanhood. This is important because she is speaking up about not being able to write songs that talk about the beauty of being a woman. Instead, she is being judged by the public for not writing songs about sexualizing the female figure. She essentially is standing up for feminism and has become an important figure in Fourth Wave Feminism with this example.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">So what about her songs? In the song, &ldquo;This Is What Makes Us Girls&rdquo;, she shares the power of being a woman in her song. Specifically, it mentions being in a relationship with a man (controversial towards gender identity) and how they are not the power you need. It&rsquo;s being a woman that is what &ldquo;makes us girls&rdquo;. </span><a href="https://nadyazura.medium.com/understanding-lana-del-rey-as-a-feminist-existensialist-4427b680fec7"><span style="font-weight: 400;">An article states that. &ldquo;As long as women never try to reveal their body through biology, history, and technology the long woman still becomes a woman, not a human being.&rdquo;</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Lana Del Ray&rsquo;s songs are important to Fourth Wave Feminism because she is writing songs about how amazing it is to be a woman, versus talking about how sexy they are like other artists.&nbsp;</span></p>

<h4><i>Beyonce's Performance at the MTV Music Awards (2014) (Bottom) - <h4><i>Beyonce.***Flawless ft. Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie. 2013 (Top)</i></h4> </i></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another musician who makes songs about Feminism is the legendary Beyonce. The megastar not only creates songs about feminism but it can also be seen in her performances as well. </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0VYHRLDpic"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In her 2014 MTV Music Awards performance, she performs her song, &ldquo;Flawless&rdquo; which is a song about feminism</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. On top of this, she has a quote about Feminism in the introduction of her performance. The quote is from Nigerian writer Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie at a TEDxEuston conference where she states &ldquo;We Should All Be Feminists.&rdquo; The song itself has two meanings: (1) the diamond jewelry that demonstrates the luxury of Beyonce&rsquo;s life and (2) the flawlessness of the jewelry showing that all women are flawless and to never be ashamed of who you are. Her lyrics in the song talk about teaching girls to be proud women in the future rather than teaching them to be second-rate to men. The meaning of the song is similar to &ldquo;This Is What Makes Us Girls&rdquo; by Lana Del Rey. Both explore the power of being a woman and how we should teach young girls to become leaders in the future. Flawless is a powerful song in Fourth Wave Feminism because it explores the issue of teaching young girls to be powerful leaders in the future and to teach all women to be proud of themselves.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h6><strong>Movies and Television</strong></h6>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fourth Wave Feminism also has a substantial role in film and television with women being the lead stars in most media. Examples of video media that demonstrate this are Juno, Bridesmaids, and Orange is The New Black. These films and television series are examples of how Feminism is impacting the movie and television industry.</span></p>
<p2><span style="font-weight: 400;"><iframe title="YouTube video player" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/K0SKf0K3bxg?start=562" width="560" height="315" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"></iframe></span></p2>
<h4><i>Juno (2007) </i></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;In 2007, screenplay writer </span><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0467406/plotsummary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Diablo Cody releases her first major film titled, Juno</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The film is centered around the lead character, Juno MacGuff who becomes pregnant with a failed rockstar named Mark. Both Mark and Juno face the issue of keeping the child or setting the unborn child up for adoption. The film is the first of Diablo Cody where she explores the theme of women's struggles. In the film Juno, Cody wanted to create a film that explores the struggles of early, unwanted pregnancies and the struggles that women have to face. Since the film&rsquo;s creation, it has become a hit with Diablo Cody creating films centered around women's struggles such as Jennifer&rsquo;s Body, Tully, and Young Adult. Cody would also win the Oscar for Best Original Screenplay for Juno, making her one of the first majorly successful female screenwriters to win a major academy award. The film Juno and Diablo Cody both show their impact on the film industry by showing that a film about the struggles of a woman can be successful.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p2><span style="font-weight: 400;"><iframe title="YouTube video player" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FNppLrmdyug?start=562" width="560" height="315" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"></iframe></span></p2>
<h4><i>Bridesmaids (2011) </i></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bridesmaids (2011)&nbsp; is another film that combines comedy with romance. The film is about a single woman named Annie who has a messy life and becomes the maid of honor for her best friend Lillian. Annie then meets Lillian's other best friend Helen, who competes for Lilian's friendship. The film is known for being one of the most popular feminist movies in the Fourth Wave Feminist movement. The impact of This film shows that films created by women, for women, can also be a commercial success.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p2><span style="font-weight: 400;"><iframe title="YouTube video player" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vY0qzXi5oJg?start=562" width="560" height="315" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"></iframe></span></p2>
<h4><i>Orange Is The New Black (2013) </i></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2013, Orange Is the New Black debuted on the Netflix streaming service. The cast is both racially diverse and features a full female cast. The target audience of the show is women. In a similar goal to Bridesmaids, the show is a show created by women, for women. The show follows a cast of female inmates in prison. The lead character, Piper Chapman is convicted of dealing drugs which causes her to be imprisoned for 15 months. The show follows her experience in a comedic drama format. The importance of feminism is prevalent in the show, but also with gender identity as well. The show is also known for making transgender actress Laverne Cox a megastar. It would be the show that kickstarts her career as the first widely known transgender megastar showing representation in the LGBTQ community. Overall, Orange Is The New Black combines these themes of feminism, race, and gender identity with its cast and themes which makes it very impactful on the television industry.&nbsp;</span></p>

<h6><strong>Literature</strong></h6>
<p2><strong><img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41wmScO2UaL.jpg" alt="Roxane Gay. Bad Feminist. 2014" /></strong></p2>
<h4><i>Roxane Gay. Bad Feminist: Essays. 2014 </i></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Possibly one of the best examples of Fourth Wave Feminism&rsquo;s impact on media is the novel, &ldquo;<a class="inline_disabled" href="https://www.amazon.com/Bad-Feminist-Essays-Roxane-Gay/dp/0062282719" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bad Feminist: Essays</a> &rdquo; written by Roxane Gay in 2014. In the novel, Gay talks about a variety of topics about feminist culture and her experience being a black woman in America. She explores this with her frustrations towards the way she was treated as a woman or a person of color. Further in the book, she talks about the myth of a &ldquo;post-feminist&rdquo; world where she talks about films such as Bridesmaids, Girls, Twilight, and Fifty Shades of Grey as &ldquo;a myth to SLOW women down.&rdquo; To elaborate further, she says that those films are a bad example of female representation, stating &ldquo;Abandon the cultural myth that all female friendships must be bitchy, toxic, or competitive.&rdquo; Gay explains that films such as these are not examples that feminists should follow. Instead, Gay mentions that The Hunger Games series character Katniss is a great example of what a woman should be. Katniss is a character who has to deal with her struggles as a young woman and is forced to become stronger to protect herself. There is more than the book mentions about politics, race, etc. However, the book is crucial to Fourth Wave Feminism because it expresses Gay&rsquo;s personal experience and perspective on feminism in culture and media.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h6><strong>Conclusion</strong></h6>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In conclusion, Fourth Wave Feminism has a major impact on media and culture in a variety of ways. In social media, the MeToo movement was important for giving a voice to women. This would be supported by statistics that demonstrate how the MeToo movement increased the number of female users on social media. This would be beneficial to giving women a voice to speak up about their sexual abuse history. Lady Gaga is an example of a celebrity who would use social media to speak about her sexual abuse history. In art and design, Cassie Mcquarter, Kumikaho Oshima, and the Pussyhat project all demonstrate femininity through artworks. In music, Beyonce and Lana Del Rey all have created songs that talk about feminism. In film and shows, Diablo Cody, Orange Is The New Black, and Bridesmaids are examples of how films and shows created by women, for women can be a commercial success. Lastly, the novel Bad Feminist: Essays demonstrates the issues of feminism and Gay&rsquo;s personal perspective of feminism. These are examples that show the impact of Fourth Wave Feminism in media and culture.&nbsp;</span></p>

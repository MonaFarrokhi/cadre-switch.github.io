	<h2>
		Article Body
	</h2>
	<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the modern world, where everything is moving at a fast pace, to get the information across the majority of people or reshape public awareness, magazines, advertisements, newspapers, books, social media, and webs require photos to go along as a visual attention element. Thus, acting as an attention-getter, photos are mostly edited, retouched, or in general, manipulated. Images were done so to efficiently promote the idea or quickly convey the message rather than solely relying on the text itself. Tracing back to the Switch article, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Metamorphoses Digital Photography in the Electronic Age and Pixel Perfect: Digital Photography in the Bay Area</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (1998), which discussed the arisen digital photography contains photo manipulation processes in the two exhibitions at the San Jose Museum of Modern Art. (1) The artworks stirred controversies over whether digitally manipulated photographs are forms of art because their origins were altered. Despite being a controversial topic up until now due to its deceiving aspect, photo manipulation still holds an essential role in the modern digital world.</span></p>
	<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, what exactly is photo manipulation? And how is it done? As the name suggests, it is a process of modifying the original image. In more detail, as Kelsie Rimmer mentioned in </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Digital Art Trend: Photo Manipulation</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, &ldquo;...photo manipulation often involves blending photos, graphics and other visual elements together to create bizarre, out-of-this world artworks and effects.&rdquo; (2) It includes a wide range of changes from the minor scope with photo editings such as color or exposure adjustments with tone curves and color balance. Or, to a significant scale like photo bashing technique that adds, replaces, and blends multiple photos, may contain double or multiple exposures, into one final work just as Aron Visuals shows in one of his artworks, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Undiscovered Land</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. (3) Regardless of the wonderful outcomes, many people still refer to photo manipulation as photo&rsquo; tampering&rsquo; rather than an artist&rsquo;s production because of countless misuse cases to deceive others.</span></p>

	<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Everything has its advantages and drawbacks, and so does photo manipulation. Nowadays, the advancement in social media has changed the way people perceive information. It also gives rise to more phishing schemes and false propaganda acts to gain sales or increase believers for a fictitious belief through photo manipulation. Moreover, some research even shows that with the birth of beautifying apps, filters put a toll on people&rsquo;s mental health and self-esteem. Hence, stirring the controversy around manipulated images and their legitimacy, as well as being altered to what extent for it to be considered appropriate. For example, the FaceApp application.</span></p>
	<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">FaceApp is a face-altering photo app developed by a Russian company and released worldwide in 2017. It uses advanced artificial intelligence (AI) to apply filters over the user&rsquo;s face; some of its notable features is the aging ability to make users appear younger or older than their actual look. However, upon release, FaceApp encountered racial statements with the trending filter that promised to make users look &lsquo;hotter.&rsquo; Apparently, what it did was only &lsquo;whitening&rsquo; people&rsquo;s skin tone and trying to turn them into white. This filter seemingly wants to imply that white skin tone is the standard of beauty for all human races, and any skin tone that is different from white is considered not beautiful. (4) Moreover, there is a more significant potential threat for all of its users - privacy violation. The terms and services of FaceApp clearly state that &ldquo;You grant FaceApp a perpetual, irrevocable, nonexclusive, royalty-free, worldwide, fully-paid, transferable sub-licensable license to use, reproduce, modify, adapt, publish, translate, create derivative works...without compensation to you.&rdquo; (5) It means that all of the users&rsquo; photos will be stored on the cloud indefinitely and reused as much as the developers want. This is even more dangerous than before with the advanced AI technology. &lsquo;Deepfake,&rsquo; for instance, is a recent technology that can completely alter and match a person&rsquo;s face with another one, which can be used for fraudulent purposes in politics, advertisements, or even worse, pornographic. Lastly, FaceApp is also one of the pioneer applications to redefine the new beauty standards.</span></p>

	<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the explosion of social media platforms such as Instagram, Facebook, Snapchat, or Tiktok, photo manipulation has severely distorted reality. All of the applications mentioned above have one thing in common - a built-in beauty filter. Like FaceApp, these filters also modify the user&rsquo;s body&rsquo;s features like v-line face shape, smooth skin, double eyelids, bump-up lips, thin nose, tiny waist, and so on. Little by little, the images with filtered-on posts posted on social media have become a new unrealistic beauty standard among generations, and everyone goes crazy over it, especially young people. These beauty filters are changing the way they see themselves and gradually affecting their mental health. (6) It makes them unconsciously constantly criticize their body, thus lowering their self-image and self-esteem. Moreover, social media has helped many people become famous easily with just a few photos or videos of them using face filters. For example, an incident of a Chinese vlogger called &ldquo;Your Highness Qiao Biluo,&rdquo; whose appearance was a seductively young lady in all of her live streams. She accidentally revealed her real face because of a glitch during one of her streams, which turned out to be the face of a middle-aged woman. (7) Ultimately, influencers who use face filters create a trending wave of obsession with unrealistic beauty standards because the more beautiful you appear on social media, the more followers you acquire.</span></p>
	<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite it being a controversial topic, photo manipulation still holds an essential role in the modern digital world by helping artists to create more appealing visual images that can spark inspiration. It allows artists to express themselves freely or push the context to another extreme level about philosophy, environment, or even world crisis. Remarkably,</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Infilteriterations</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by Huntrezz Janos, a Los Angeles Afrohungarian artist, tackles and reverses the deceitful feature of photo manipulation. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Infilteriterations</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is an online exhibition utilizing the augmented reality face filter that allows users to express their virtual identity and artistic style during the chaotic time of the COVID-19 pandemic, whether it is dreamy, epic, or dramatic. (8) Or artists like Rosa Menkman with the distorted </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">365 Perfect Decalibration</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> series to counter the idea of the original 365 Perfect beautify app. As Menkman explained, the series is &ldquo;not only a powerful commentary on the relationship between mobile technology and the beauty industry but a careful exploration of generation loss.&rdquo; (9)&nbsp;</span></p>

	<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Additionally, it aids concept artists in their workflow to achieve the desired result in a short amount of time. In the film and video games industry,&nbsp; photo manipulation is used during the concept art stage, where ideas are required to be generated quickly with the readable quality of materials. Take the game developer Mikko Kautto&rsquo;s </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">W20150706 - Photobashing Combat Droid</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as an example. (10) Kautto shows the step-by-step workflow of how he compiled and edited photos to create a realistic concept model of a combat droid. Thus, photo manipulation has proven to help artists produce high-quality works while saving an immense amount of time. Moreover, the high quality can clarify the texture or materials needed to be used when further executing the concept in the game or film environment.</span></p>

		    </p>
    	<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After all, art is the expression of one&rsquo;s mind and feelings; therefore, no doubt digitally manipulated photography is a form of art. Photo manipulation is indeed a powerful and extraordinary technique for concept artists and all artists, in general, to bring their creativity to life. Nevertheless, it is so powerful to the point that it is capable of causing negative or positive impacts upon society depending on abusing or enhancing changes in visuals via mainstream media. Thus, it is wise to keep a subjective opinion while contemplating photos you encounter in everyday life unless there is a disclaimer.</span></p>

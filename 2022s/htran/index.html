        Abstract
      </h2>

      <p>
        In the 90's, electronic games have grown Big. From a slightly suspicious intruder and challenger to mainstream media, like the cinema and broadcast television, the game industry has developed into a full-blown sector of today's commercial media landscape. Their ubiquity is having a powerful effect on the cultural imaginaries of the late 20th century. The game-playing experience is irrevocably linked to an "apparatus", a prefabricated system regulating the relationship(s) between the player and the system. It is essential that the player is made to feel part of a network that is both internal (the ties with the world of the game) and external.

The game patch is the latest manifestation of "tactical media", a new way of "talking back to the media". Tactical media has a long history going back to John Heartfield's political photomontages of the 1920's and 30's, to the Situationists and "appropriation art" of the 1970s. Instead, a scratch video was co-opted by the very institutions it sought to undermine. The position of game patch art is not without its contradictions. Unlike scratch video, it has a promising channel of distribution at its disposal, the Internet. Yet, like any form of appropriation art, it will have to deal with issues of copyright and intellectual property.

      <p>When I first became aware of the game patch phenomenon, not such a longtime ago, it felt almost preordained - it just had to happen. Not because of the will of some transcendental "dungeon master", presiding over the gaming arena that is the contemporary world, but rather because of the logic of media. In the 90's, electronic games have grown Big. From a slightly suspicious intruder and a challenger to mainstreammedia, like the cinema and broadcast television, the game industry has developed into a full-blown sector of today's commercial media landscape, constantly conquering new territory. Not only have electronic games gained popularity among new age groups -their breakthrough in the old people's home seems only a matter of time- they have also become an internalized model for an interactive relationship with the media, influencing other forms of computerized and computer-mediated communication. Although they will not (at least in the foreseeable future) have enough power to render traditional one-way media totally obsolete, their very ubiquity is having a powerful effect on the cultural imaginaries of the late 20th century.On the other hand, drawing a sharp distinction between the kind of new media relationship represented by computer gaming and the "passive" experiences provided by cinema and television would mean overstating the issue. After all, electronic gaming may have been invented by computer hackers, technical whiz-kids and hippie entrepreneurs, but especially in the 90's it has been absorbed by the worlds of big business and venture capitalism. Integration, consolidation, expansion - these are the magic formulas today's game producers and distributors invoke.

        Abstract
      </h2>

      <p>
        In the 90's, electronic games have grown Big. From a slightly suspicious intruder and challenger to mainstream media, like the cinema and broadcast television, the game industry has developed into a full-blown sector of today's commercial media landscape. Their ubiquity is having a powerful effect on the cultural imaginaries of the late 20th century. The game-playing experience is irrevocably linked to an "apparatus", a prefabricated system regulating the relationship(s) between the player and the system. It is essential that the player is made to feel part of a network that is both internal (the ties with the world of the game) and external.

The game patch is the latest manifestation of "tactical media", a new way of "talking back to the media". Tactical media has a long history going back to John Heartfield's political photomontages of the 1920's and 30's, to the Situationists and "appropriation art" of the 1970s. Instead, a scratch video was co-opted by the very institutions it sought to undermine. The position of game patch art is not without its contradictions. Unlike scratch video, it has a promising channel of distribution at its disposal, the Internet. Yet, like any form of appropriation art, it will have to deal with issues of copyright and intellectual property.

      <p>When I first became aware of the game patch phenomenon, not such a longtime ago, it felt almost preordained - it just had to happen. Not because of the will of some transcendental "dungeon master", presiding over the gaming arena that is the contemporary world, but rather because of the logic of media. In the 90's, electronic games have grown Big. From a slightly suspicious intruder and a challenger to mainstreammedia, like the cinema and broadcast television, the game industry has developed into a full-blown sector of today's commercial media landscape, constantly conquering new territory. Not only have electronic games gained popularity among new age groups -their breakthrough in the old people's home seems only a matter of time- they have also become an internalized model for an interactive relationship with the media, influencing other forms of computerized and computer-mediated communication. Although they will not (at least in the foreseeable future) have enough power to render traditional one-way media totally obsolete, their very ubiquity is having a powerful effect on the cultural imaginaries of the late 20th century.On the other hand, drawing a sharp distinction between the kind of new media relationship represented by computer gaming and the "passive" experiences provided by cinema and television would mean overstating the issue. After all, electronic gaming may have been invented by computer hackers, technical whiz-kids and hippie entrepreneurs, but especially in the 90's it has been absorbed by the worlds of big business and venture capitalism. Integration, consolidation, expansion - these are the magic formulas today's game producers and distributors invoke.

<h2><p><strong>Patching or Marketing tools</strong></p></h2>
<p><strong>Introduction:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Electronic games </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">have become an internalized model for an interactive relationship with the media. "Tactical media" is a new way of "talking back to the media", of engaging in a creative/destructive conversation. It has a promising channel of distribution at its disposal, the Internet. Specifically, a </span><strong>game patch</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> considers it a commercial product to gain property. But like with any form of appropriation art, it will have to deal with issues of copyright and intellectual property.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Body:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Game patch: </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like any other software, video games receive patches to fix compatibility issues after their initial release, but they can also be used to change game rules or algorithms.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Example: "Companies&mdash;too numerous to mention&mdash;who release shoddy products knowing they can get by with patches and upgrades, and who make 'pay-testers of their customers," wrote Scorpia in 1994.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Game patch developed: </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">an alteration or add-on to computer games is usually unsanctioned. Unlike ordinary software patches, game patches don't just correct code behind the scenes. They also include the act of tearing open a finished program to get at the underlying code.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example:&nbsp; "Tomb Raider I and II Patches" are patches of the original "Nude Raider" patch. Created by the hacktivist collective RTMark in alliance with one of the game's programmers, this patch infiltrated the game as it was being made. (Cracking the Maze Online Exhibit, Anne-Marie Schleiner on Jul 16, 1999)</span></p>
<p><strong>Scratch video maker: </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">British video art movement that emerged in the early to mid-1980s. It was characterized by the use of found footage, fast cutting, and multi-layered rhythms.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, video tricks to turn Reagan and Thatcher's media images into stuttering marionettes who acted like aliens or lunatics and said things that were counter to official protocol but close to the thoughts that really crossed their minds, as once suspected. (Plug-ins and Patches as Hacker Art, Erkki Huhtamo on Jul 16 1999)&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Game patch artist: </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">is often a generalist animator and/or 3D modeler who creates both 2D and 3D art for video games. Working from design briefs and concept art, game artists give expression to the script from the storyboard to populate the world of the game.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example: demonstrate this awareness by including references to beloved early classics such as Space Invaders or Pac-Man in their work; there are others for whom history, at least on a conscious level, is irrelevant. (Plug-ins and Patches as Hacker Art, Erkki Huhtamo on Jul 16 1999)</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Machinima art: </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Machinima &ndash; a portmanteau of machine and cinema &ndash; is a term used to describe the process of using real-time computer graphics engines to create a cinematic production.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong> </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, one of Arcangel's most well-known works, NES cartridge hacks, is an artist's take on various aspects of popular culture. Both video installations featured modified versions of Super Mario Bros. (1985) from 2002 and 2005. Unlike the first, the second is a color-shifted, graphically warped surrealist modification of the original game's scrolling vista of pixelated white clouds and blue skies. It's an example of machinima's credo of creating something new from found materials, which is central to the genre.</span></p>
<p><strong>Approaches and purposes: </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">The desire, to reassert player agency as a creator, or a desire to subvert gender norms, such as the portrayal of women in games, may drive a patch artist. As with the scratch video makers, the game patch artists don't seem to believe in the politically correct position of suppressing pleasure. Although political determination should not be overemphasized. One of the most important aspects of the game patching experience is the ability to demonstrate mastery through creative tinkering with the source code. This provides a link to the hacker mentality that has always been a part of the history of electronic gaming.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Electronic games are an internalized model for an interactive relationship with the media, which has a powerful effect on the cultural imaginaries of the late 20th century. In terms of the game patches,&nbsp; it might be seen as a highly heterogeneous body of reactions against the growing uniformity and calculation that have come to dominate the industrial game culture. It can be seen as an art in the future and a medium to convey diverse issues (media guerrilla activity), operating on the terrain between the legal and the illegal, or will it become a "civilized", law-abiding genre, perhaps sponsored by major game companies, and contributing to future game development</span></p>

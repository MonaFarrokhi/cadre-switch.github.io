In order to keep up with the rapidly growing technology in today's world. This article aims to educate the viewers about this somewhat new piece of technology that has the potential to grow with us in the future. That being an NFT the basis of this research was focusing on the history of NFTs and what they are as well as answering questions about the blockchain and how one interacts with NFTs. And analysing the environmental consequences, pros/cons  and the right click culture.

<!-- <p><strong>Abstract:</strong></p> -->
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this article, I will be exploring the up-and-coming technologies of NFTs. For those unaware of what an NFT is, an NFT is a non-fungible token. The word non- fungible is the keyword in this acronym it basically means non-replaceable. Something that is non-fungible cannot be replicated and is irreplaceable a prime example of this in the real world. Would be the</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Vitruvian Man</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by Leonardo Da Vinci,&nbsp; the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;Vitruvian Man</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as we all know is a renowned anatomical drawing showcased in Venice, Italy. We all have an idea of what the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vitruvian Man </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">looks like, which is the original copy and where it resides. This artwork is a once-in-a-lifetime piece, there is no replication that can amount to the value of the artwork or look anywhere close to it this is a one of one and we have authenticators that prove that. Thus making it non-fungible something that is fungible is the opposite of a non-fungible item, it is a product created in the mass, all look the same and are the same. An example of something that is fungible is a notebook, they all contain paper, roughly the same value as other notebooks, and are created in the masses. The token in the acronym refers to the digital asset you are receiving The origin of the first NFTs date back to the early 2010s by a digital artist named Kevin McCoy who minted the first NFT on the name coin blockchain. The idea of the blockchain sounds like a confusing topic but as you read the article you will see it is easy to understand than you thought. The blockchain in retrospect is similar to how banks work with each other to authenticate transactions. But instead of banks there's hundreds of computers continuously watching the blockchain authenticating any transaction. But it is important to note an NFT will not be on the blockchain until it has had a transaction or trade. 
&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though NFTs are a very unique piece of technology that could help shape the world of digital art as we know it today. It does have some cons about it that negatively impact the environment as well as a cult following of people against NFTs saying they are a waste of money and one could just “screenshot”. According to media company The Verge research has led them to believe that an average NFTs carbon footprint is on average the same as a EU citizen in a month. The article further mentions that companies have not been fully transparent with the data. Which causes more eyebrows to be raised due to the release of some of the data that seemed very one sided. 

Energy usage begins to be one of the leading problems to NFTs and the greenhouse gas emission. But there is another problem and that is the ability to easily replicate an NFT, the right click save method or a screenshot. Something that many NFT naysayers  do not understand is that is what an NFT is meant to do. Yes you can probably create an easy replica for this NFT, but it will never have the same value and according to the blockchain there is only a circulation of one of those assets. Furthermore, as the NFT buyer you do receive the original files and assets that are used in creating that specific project.
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now the big question: How are NFTs important?? Well to begin the reason NFTs are so important and why they will be so impactful is due to how they are helping Digital Artist. Prior to this there was no real market for digital art to create these pieces as assets and authenticate them similar to the real life art world. The creation of NFT’s has allowed Digital Artist to finally sell their work as a 1 of 1 piece. This new technology has allowed digital art to be in transition to a newer fine art stage in its life. A somewhat young life of NFTs there have been many successful projects and one of the most successful would be from the 3D artist Beeple. Beeple who had a collection titled EVERYDAYS: THE FIRST 5000 fig 1. Which created literal art history as the most expensive NFT ever sold at a whopping 69,346,250$. It was a documentation of all his accumulated work within the past 13 years of artwork he created daily. Along with Beeple's project there has been other successful NFTs, another beign a Crypto Punk series that as well sold on Christies for 16 million dollars fig 2.
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As I wrap up on my final words, I do have this to say. If NFTs want to stay on a positive track they need to take care of some issues that I believe can be detrimental to the technology. That for one is the environmental consequences if we are only emitting bad back into our environment. How will we continue to progress with our technology if our home world is slowly deteriorating. Another growing issue I have personally heard of are growing scams of NFTs and projects that are there to deceive their buyers. Lastly, I would say is that though screenshotting or saving the image was a problem it is becoming less prevalent as there are systems that warrant safety of your assets. Overall, I think NFTs are nowhere close to their peak potential, still in the very early stages with many kinks that need to be worked out but just as many promises that this will be a great piece of technology.

The article introduces the concept of working together on an enormous canvas. r/place was a collaborative initiative and social experiment that first started on April Fools' Day 2017.

      <h2>Article: <br> r/place: an enormous collaborative art project and its chaos</h2>
      <p>Artists worldwide are fascinated by cooperative or collective techniques of artistic production that combine art, social engagement, and community development. Collaborative art experiences in which the community develops, sometimes in collaboration with an artist, and then helps spread the art endeavor are known as collaborative art creation. Collaborative community art, like social sculpture, shapes a community's visual aesthetic while also strengthening communal bonds. Arts organizations are attempting to provide access to art-making activities in various settings, ranging from parks to libraries. In recent years, collaborative arts have been developing in digital media. This paper will introduce a unique communication-making art cooperation in digital media and social interactions by studying digital art content created from sharing and collaboration through a subreddit called r/place.</p>

      <p>R/place, 2022, 4000 x 4000 pixels, accessed 21 May, 2022, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/place/comments/twft1q/full_screenshot_of_rplace_2022/">https://www.reddit.com/r/place/comments/twft1q/full_screenshot_of_rplace_2022/</a> </p>
      <br> <p>r/place was a collaborative initiative and social experiment that first started on April Fools' Day 2017 and rebooted on April Fools' Day 2022 on the social networking site Reddit. Josh Wardle came up with the experiment's concept first in 2017. The 2017 experiment involved an online canvas hosted on the r/place subreddit, which registered users may update by replacing a single pixel's color with a replacement from a 16-color palette. Individually registered users could place one single colored pixel (or "tile") on an online canvas of one million (1000 &times; 1000) pixel squares and wait a set amount of time before placing another on both instances. A timer stopped the user from inserting any more pixels for a period ranging from 5 to 20 minutes after placing each pixel. On April 3, 2017, Reddit admins ended the experiment 72 hours later. Over 1 million active users modified the canvas, putting a total of approximately 16 million pixels, and over 90,000 users were actively watching or altering the canvas when the experiment concluded. The project was praised for accurately portraying the culture of Reddit's online communities and Internet culture in general. Reddit restarted the experiment on April 1, 2022, and it lasted four days.</p>
     <br>  <p>The 1000x1000 pixel canvas was offered to developers for 72 hours when r/place first launched in 2017. Approximately 1.2 million Reddit users worked together to create the world's largest art project, using 16.5 million tiles to paint a million-pixel canvas. People united, formed alliances, and waged conflicts to defend their lands. People all over the world used subreddits and private Discord chats for discussion. The final product was nothing short of a masterpiece! Reproductions of well-known artworks such as the Mona Lisa and A Starry Night were created. Pop culture references were also scattered over the artwork by fandoms.</p>

     <br>  <p>After five years, the team agreed to develop again in 2022 on April Fool's Day. The canvas size was the same 1000x1000 pixel square on day one. Most Reddit users were surprised by the event's start, but it wasn't until day two that things indeed altered. Subreddits scrambled to enlarge their art, while several lesser subreddits saw an opportunity to put down an image when the canvas suddenly doubled in size. The canvas then doubled again on day 3, making 4 million pixels accessible. From April 1 to April 5, almost 6 million users placed roughly 72 million dots on the canvas, averaging more than 2.5 million dots each hour. The event's primary goal was to bring together a variety of art genres and internet subcultures on one canvas for a pleasant experience.&nbsp;<br /><br>The identity part of Reddit is self-evident: each subreddit has its own identity, which each user in that subreddit subscribes to somehow. As a result, belonging to a subreddit entails belonging to a group. This is especially true on r/place, which brings together individuals from various subreddits. Despite the large size of the canvas, it is difficult to discover any unoccupied spot that has not been "claimed" by someone. Every available square inch has been covered in patterns depicting subreddits. If you participated in the three-day social experiment, this is probably natural to you. It's impossible to build alone because each user can only place a tiny tile every five minutes. The five-minute wait time throttles any single person's ability to dominate the canvas. Therefore as a group, users instead need to work concurrently and produce harmonized communities to create collective works of pixel art to express their identity. After all, maintaining any pixel art on such a crowded platform necessitated a level of organization that people can only achieve through collaborations. The unit of organization is quite organically subreddits. Every subreddit wants to be a part of history for a once-in-a-lifetime event. As a result, people who are already like-minded and share a typical identity band claim a piece of the canvas. It is theirs to defend and be proud of that subtle pixel art that reflects "them" and "their individuality." The final image is as detailed because of the strong sense of identification that comes from Reddit.</p>
     <br>  <p>Communities were able to create works of art by cooperating in the middle of chaos. However, regular monitoring and dedication are required to conserve these works of art. Even if you place artwork, it would be gone even in a few minutes if you couldn't defend it. It became one of the crucial issues that happened during this project. People were fighting over each other for a pixel for their communities. Understandably, the situation is inevitable as the project only has a certain number of pixels while many people are out who want to speak their minds. In this pixel warfare, smaller communities became exclusive at the expense of larger influencers who have more power in getting people to work together. Many people assume that large Twitch streamers try to sabotage the project by destroying the work of smaller communities. As the argument goes, they are pushing their hundreds of thousands of fans to conquer hotly contested territory instead of being a democratic representation of online communities and their work.</p>
     <br>  <p>This art project involves more than just individuals. Not only do people sabotage other people in this massive collaborative project, but bots are also a part of the chaos in r/place. Many people believe that "bots" are rampant, performing automated activities in ways that contradict the idea of this artwork is a manifestation of human success rather than technical prowess. In addition to these significant issues, this project has more chaos, such as streamers receiving death threats from the internet or inappropriate artworks displayed on the canvas.</p>
     <br>  <p>r/place came to an abrupt and spectacular end on Monday evening. There was only one color option for the community: white. The r/Place community then proceeded to delete all of their weekend efforts. It was unexpectedly satisfying and contemplative, a distinctive way to cap off a fantastic adventure. R/Place fostered new streaming collaborations, broke down language boundaries, spawned a slew of great stories, and produced some magnificent art in the process. Like many people on the internet, I hope it becomes an annual event rather than a once-in-a-half-decade occurrence. R/place is an innovative way to express your voice, community, and creativity.</p>

    <p><strong><i>Abstract</i></strong></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">    This article discusses the application of blockchain in the field of arts and crafts. In the time of globalization, mass produced commodities are a common sight, with each product having thousands of copies ready to be replaced at the moment of notice. Arts and crafts, for the most part, are still stuck in a limbo state of being priced based on their uniqueness–the more copies the artwork has, the less the work is appreciated. When blockchain technology started being applied in your average daily life, NFTs made a splash when the token was used in transaction for ownership of digital artwork; there were many ripples follow the splash, ranging from group advocating for NFTs to the right-click-save-as movement from the anti-NFTs group. This article plans on exploring NFTs, as well as non-NFT related applications of blockchain technology in the field of arts and crafts.</span></p>

      <p><strong><i>Introduction</i></strong></p>
    </ol>
    <ol>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Back in issue 13 of SWITCH, Steve Cisler wrote an article called “Arts, Crafts and Globalization” discussing the effect that globalization had on the field of arts and crafts around the world at the time. Steve noticed the chaos that was present in the market of arts and crafts at that time, such as folk arts being produced far from its place of origin, with the production chain with as many steps as that of an automobile’s production chain. Steve concluded his article by citing Professor Howard Besser’s use of computer databases to document the origin of arts and crafts. Years have gone by since issue 13, and we now live in a world with new technologies–I think the time has come for an article that can act as an update on these topics, and at the same time, a record of the contemporary state of the arts and crafts.</span></p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <ol>
      <p><strong><i>Body</i></strong></p>
    </ol>
    <ol><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, what is blockchain? To know blockchains, first we need to know smart contracts. Smart contract is a self-executing code that conducts a series of commands in an autonomous, trustless, decentralized and transparent manner; they are irreversible and unmodifiable once deployed</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">; these smart contracts are the foundation of a blockchain application called Ethereum. Ethereum is an open-sourced platform, launched in 2013 by Vitalik Buterin. Users can build decentralized applications using smart contracts on this platform; since Ethereum is open-source, anyone can participate as developers</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">NFT&ndash;which stands for non-fungible token&ndash;is a derivative of Ethereum, built as a cryptocurrency. Essentially, NFT, on the fundamental level, is similar to other cryptocurrencies; however, NFT comes with unmodifiable metadata in their smart contracts, which stores information for built-in authentication&ndash;owner ID, NFT name, NFT description, blockchain name that hosts the NFT, to name a few. There are other forms of NFT that exist outside of Ethereum ones as well. There are also different methods to verify NFT that don't use metadata</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Blockchains have been around for at least ten years by the time of this writing. There are many applications that have been using blockchains, but what brought blockchains to the mainstream was NFT and the high-value, high-density trade of digital artworks</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The 2021 sale of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Everydays: The First 5,000 Days</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at Christie&rsquo;s Auction House</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was the first digital art sale using NFT &ldquo;as a guarantee of its authenticity&rdquo;, setting precedent for the boom of NFT in the art world. As I&rsquo;m publishing this writing, the term being used to refer to these NFT/blockchain art is Crypto Art. Since blockchains is decentralized by design</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, transparency is a big benefit of Crypto Art&ndash;since these token stores timestamp of each transaction automatically and trustlessly. In the art world, this means art trading can take place much quicker since the verification process can be done online in a more organized, albeit also more tech-demanding manner. In addition, Crypto Art isn&rsquo;t limited to just digital art, but physical artwork could also be turned into Crypto Art through a process called </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tokenisation</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. There are many ways to conduct this process, but the process can be summed up in this quote: &ldquo;There are many different ways to process but the easiest is to take a picture of the work with your smartphone camera.&rdquo; But then, paying a large amount of money for a </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">picture</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of the artwork hardly seems worth it?! This question brings us to the next point: What do you get in a NFT transaction?</span></p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Long story short, you get the right(s) to the artwork when you buy its NFT. And this is good news for both artists and patrons. Digital artists and artworks have existed before NFT, yet there was rarely any sales of digital art worth writing home about since digital art ownership could not be verified. The sale of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Everydays</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was the first time a digital artwork sold for more than physical artwork&ndash;and this phenomenon was thanks to the concept known as </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">digital scarcity</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Using NFT and its smart contracts to verify the authenticity of the artwork introduces the concept of limit to digital art, and when the concept of limit is brought forth, so does supply and demand&ndash;likewise for potential of huge sales and profit. What&rsquo;s more, the artist of the work can include a clause for royalties, which gives them a claim of an amount of future sales&ndash;something that does not exist in the traditional art trade. What about the patrons? In regards to buyers, NFT benefits them by simplifying the authentication process&ndash;since everything was recorded in part of the blockchains of the NFT. Patrons can also negotiate to buy partial royalties and/or reproduction of the artwork&ndash;this could potentially be very beneficial if the patrons want multiple forms of displays for the artwork they purchased, instead of just one original work in the case of traditional art.</span></p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Crypto art, or future derivatives of blockchains, can serve to democratize the art world by connecting artists to patrons in decentralized realms. Since crypto arts are built upon the application of blockchains, decentralization is the nature of these works&ndash;users can see records of the artwork, dating back to the moment the work was minted. The NFT marketplace was populated by Christie&rsquo;s&ndash;one of the powerhouse in art trade</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ndash;which means their competitors are quickly catching up on these gold rushes, which in turn contributes to the growth of more blockchains platforms where artists can interact and research larger pools of potential patrons without worrying about the geographical limitation in the real world: any artists can freely promote their works, and any patrons can browse through thousands or millions of NFT for sale, or even contracting their favorite artist to commissions a unique work of art. Although the NFT field might be organic and chaotic at this moment, I suspect before long the &ldquo;free-market&rdquo; will once again be controlled by big players who have strong buying/selling power, as well as the control of propaganda devices&ndash;the struggle between consumers and corporations is a timeless tale, since they hold different value at their core. Speaking of value, does crypto art bring any cultural value?&nbsp;</span></p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Back in issue 13 of SWITCH, Steve Cisler mentioned that art is the core ingredient of an individual or a culture</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">; and when we take into account that crypto arts is a product of our culture, what is happening in the Crypto Art world is a simulation of our real world. While there exist people who buy NFT because they love the art, the associated status and fame, or simply want to support the artist</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">; the majority of NFTs are currently treated more like a money-making scheme&ndash;quoting Kelani Nichole&rsquo;s line &ldquo;the artworld turning into an increasingly tech- and asset-driven field&rdquo;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. While I understand Nichole&rsquo;s idea, I would argue that NFT being treated as a commodity is not just an issue in the art world, but merely a reflection of our society: We are shaped by our environment growing up; and today&rsquo;s society taught and remind us daily to value wealth and success&ndash;so&hellip;is it really NFT&rsquo;s fault that people are trading them to make money?! If we don&rsquo;t blink an eye when businessmen break the law to make money, then why should we scrutinize when artists are simply using NFT to sell their art? Culture is a reflection of a society&rsquo;s value, not a responsibility of one group of people. For centuries, artists have been associated with the imagery of &ldquo;starving artists&rdquo;, scrutinizing anyone who dare appeal to the mainstream</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Have we forgotten how Vincent van Gogh met his end, and how his family has been after he passed away?</span></p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Steve Cisler also mentioned the issue of combating fraud with databse in the art trade back in the 2000s. I believe this is where blockchains excel compared to traditional art. Four days before I published this article, there was news of another Bored Ape NFT being stolen. The theft was a result more of a human error in nature than the technology&rsquo;s fault: The owner of the stolen NFT fell for a phishing scam&ndash;the oldest one in the book, yet apparently still effective. Since blockchain was decentralized, there was no one in charge, the token could not be returned to the owner. However, the owner was quick to go to social media to announce the theft, and OpenSea&ndash;one of the big NFT platforms&ndash;placed a label &ldquo;suspicious&rdquo; on the token, which has halted the trade since then. Granted, the vales of the token will fluctuate a lot until the return of the token to the owner, but I would argue that in this case, the artwork isn&rsquo;t loss since the &ldquo;right&rdquo; should still be Seth Green, the owner, by a general consensus&ndash;anyone attempt to buy from the theft would be liable, since all transactions are transparent. I would argue that while the issue of theft still happens, these thieveries actually show how resilient crypto arts are to fraud: The transparent nature of the technology captures all the movement of the thief, and the open platform allows for each users to quickly inform one another of foul plays, as well as the threat of isolation to the thief if they are caught. The rich database of the NFT technology is also of praise since the recording is autonomous and automatic&ndash;while the technology is still fragile, this is the first step of building more resilient techs. Going forward, the advances of blockchains technology, fraud like this should be less common. Maybe we can tokenize the user&rsquo;s account when we figure out how to lower the carbon footprint of the minting process?!</span></p>

    <ol>
      <p><strong><i>Conclusion</i></strong></p>
    </ol>
    <ol>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Blockchain and its derivatives are signs that humanity is on a trajectory to develop a decentralized technology that is totally transparent and free of manipulation. Although the technology still has quite a bit of drawbacks&ndash;high carbon footprint, tech demanding(maybe not much of a drawback later)--the database this technology builds embraces the spirit of democracy and progress.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

      Abstract
    </h2>

    <p>
      The author of this article--<a href="http://switch.sjsu.edu/archive/nextswitch/switch_engine/front/front.php%3Fartc=11.html"> Arts, Crafts, and Globalization </a>--believed art to be the core of identity of an individual or a culture; however, with globazation taking place during the early 2000s, this core ingredient was becoming more and more muddled and confusing to identify. Factors that affects the "art identity" includes, but not limited to, the international trade, the use of computer internetworking that resulted in change in the practice of art creation, art collection, and dissemination of art of all kinds--but especially prevalent in folk arts. Example of this includes the existence of folk crafts around the globe in Indonesia, such as Mexican folk art in the style of Mexican dia de los muertos, silvers jewelry from the southwest of the United States, Agade crosses from Niger.

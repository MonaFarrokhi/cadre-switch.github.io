	      Looking back at the article <a href= "http://switch.sjsu.edu/archive/nextswitch/switch_engine/front/front.php%3Fartc=222.html"> Does Lara Croft Ware Fake Polygon? </a>, questions are asked in regards to how much has women empowerment developed in not only video games, but in other realms of media such as movies and tv. This is answered with different examples of women
	      being the leading roles in different franchises and slowly setting the bar for the next female leads to follow. strong women are now more frequently seen compared to the 90s. 
	      These women are found through out popular culture and explained what it does for women, children, people of color, the LGBTQ+ community, and men.

      <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Women have come a long way in the gaming world since the 90s and have furthered the discussion of gender roles and identity issues as showcased by Anne-Marie Schleiner&rsquo;s academic journal, &ldquo;Does Lara Croft Ware Fake Polygons&rdquo;. At the turn of the century, a lot has happened for women in the world, especially in the media. Thus creating a revolution for many other communities such as for people of color, the LGBTQ+ community, and social construct created for both men and women..</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In &ldquo;Does Lara Croft Ware Fake Polygons&rdquo;, Schleiner discusses the gender roles and identity issues in the 1996 video game </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tomb Raider</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The iIntroduction of Lara Croft has changed the gaming world in regards to gender empowerment. She argues that prior to </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tomb Raider,</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> video games mainly used a male protagonist,and Lara Croft&rsquo;s introduction has revolutionized that idea. The author explores the idea that the female protagonist from the popular franchise embodies a multitude of ideas such as: a techno-puppet to the male-gaze, a drag queen, a dominatrix, and a powerful feminist role model. Artistic and creative game patches provide an &ldquo;opportunity for feminists to influence the formation of new computer game gender configurations&rdquo;.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the past 20+ years, Lara Croft has changed and developed to be more of a role model for all women. In an interview between the creative director Noah Hughes and Venture Beats, Hughes states, &ldquo;One thing I love, even in the original Tomb Raider, is that sense of determination that Lara has [&hellip;] She&rsquo;s an intellectual hero as well as a physical hero. Part of what we wanted to do was reveal some of those other facets, even showing that in game design choices. Things like the language system that celebrate her growth as not just a survivor, but also an explorer of ancient secrets&rdquo;. Lara Croft has come a long way since the 90&rsquo;s. Stronger than ever she has been in games time and time again kicking butt and going on adventures. She is able to showcase how women can be strong and independent along with being an intellectual. Strong women can also be seen in movies as well, changing the game for also women of color and in the LGBTQ+ community.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All sorts of media had the opportunity to show support for women, but more recently we had a young woman support her culture and give pride to the LGBTQ+ community in the movie world. The young and wonderful Xochitl Gomez portrays American Gomez, a Latinx LGBTQ+ teenage superhero, in the new Marvel movie, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dr. Strange: Multiverse of Madness</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In the LA Times article &lsquo;Doctor Strange&rsquo; fans &lsquo;inspired&rsquo; as America Chavez brings Latina and LGBTQ representation to the MCU an interviewee states &ldquo;I did hear about her scene with her parents and stuff on screen and how that was sort of an issue&hellip; I&rsquo;m glad that it was done really good justice&rdquo;. The character is loved due to how she is portrayed, a young female character finding her place in the &ldquo;multiverse&rdquo; and wanting to be accepted, a character who proudly wears an LGBTQ+ pin and written on her jacket &ldquo;amor es amor&rdquo;(love is love). With out going deep in to spoilers we see that she will continue to grow and hopefully become a role model not only for LGBTQ+ people and Latinx but for all adults and kids. In speaking of kids, cartoons also give a taste of women empowerment as well.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In child development, little girls were usually given the option to only play with dolls such as My Little Ponies or Barbies and cartoons such as </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Strawberry Shortcake</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, but since the 90&rsquo;s that mold was slowly being broken with cartoons like </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Powerpuff Girls</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, three little girls made to be &ldquo;perfect&rdquo; but accidentally became more than that, they became strong superheroes that fight villains and monsters every episode. Later in the 2000s we have the introduction of Teen Titans who have two female leads that are taken seriously amongst the team and trusted to do different tasks. Today, Cartoons are filled with female child leads that are going out on adventures and solving mysteries, one of the biggest being Anne Boonchuy from Disney&rsquo;s </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amphibia</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Anne, played by Brenda Song, is a young woman who travels to a different dimension filled with amphibians, and she made it her duty to help her new friends in an amphibious based war. Throughout the series we see the main character struggle and overcome any issues that face her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today a lot of media are creating characters to shed light to the diversity we have today and it&nbsp; is amazing the leaps that society is making. Of course there are setbacks and minor obstacles but as long as we can keep moving forward we can show how women in media, young and old will push society forward. I leave you off with a few questions: Are there women that you believe are great examples and role models for people in the real world? Do you feel represented with women you see in the media? If not how can society better change things to help further the human development in society?</span></p>

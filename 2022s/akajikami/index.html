<!--       Example Paragraph with Hyperlink -->
 <p>Very recently a new genre of content creator has popped up on social media platforms like Youtube and Twitch. They are called vtubers and consist of people using avatars that mimic their movements through webcam to present themselves in the online space. These avatars can range from two dimensional to fully 3D modeled characters. This caught my attention over the last year because of the animation perspective of the models, specifically the 2D ones. Personally, I have been very interested in 2D animation and these models caught my attention as such an interesting blend of motion capture and digital animation. So, over the summer I researched how to create a model and found the program Live2D Cubism. After using their site tutorials, as well as other sources on the web, I was able to make a full model that will react to my facial movements, head movement, and custom animations I have set up. In this article I will relay to you my experience with the program and the community that has arisen around it </p><br>

<p> For starters, how does Live2D work? I think this quote from an interview with Cool Dimension by Live2D sums this up pretty well. </p><br>

<p>Facial information such as the eyes, mouth, eyebrows, and direction of the face is calculated to match information from key facial points. This allows us to match the facial information of the person behind the character with that of the character to produce the expressions of one on the other. We repeatedly tweaked the algorithms and parameters to produce smooth movements before we chose the methods that produced the best results. </p><br>
<p>There is both a free and a paid version of Live2D Cubism, the main difference being that the paid version allows you to deform and add as many movements as you want while the free version limits you to just a few deformers. However, some of the work comes from outside the program, where you have to draw a model yourself. There are a myriad of ways to do this ranging from editing a still picture and cutting out key facial features and organizing them into layers or simply just drawing the model and separate it onto layers. In my case, I used Clip Studio Paint. Live2D will not simply allow you to animate a full one layer drawing, you have to break up your drawing into many different layers to move them. Think of it as a paper puppet. You have to draw/separate the moving parts into layers to then animate them within the program. Lets take my character's eye, it is not one complete layer but four different layers. The farthest back layer, for the eye, is the sclera, the next is the pupil of the eye (mine is just a white dot) and then the eyelids. However, the eye lids are just that one line that makes up the outline of the entire eye and nothing else. When I move this into Live2D I can edit the sclera to scale into a small line, while bringing the eye lid down to give the appearance of blinking. I can link this blink animation to a parameter in the program to make the model blink whenever I do. There are other tools as well such as warp deformers that &quot;is used to produce expressions that have a feeling of depth.&quot; according to the Live2D mainsite, as well as rotation deformers, which rotate parts of the model. All these work in tandem to create an animated model that moves in a fluid and lifelike way. You can see an example of mine in figure 1. <br>
Now, how does the program work in practice, how do we go from creating the animations to using them. There are a couple programs that can use the exported model from Live2D Cubism, but the one I use is VTube Studio, which is free on Steam. This program syncs up all your animations to the appropriate movements you will make, as well as allowing you to import other animations you may have made for your model and allowing you to connect them to keybindings on your keyboard. These custom animations are ones that can be made within the Live2D animator and are not connected to movements you make, so they can be dances or movements too complex to be tied to a movement of your face. An important note is that animations are only linked to your facial and head movements, there is a beta for capturing hand movements and connecting it to your models hands, but I personally have not used it.</p><br>

<p>Next, I would like to discuss some artists that I have found that have created real interesting models. The first and most prominent may be a group called Hololive. Hololive is a vtuber agency from Japan. They hold auditions through their website for those who have content creation experience. If accepted, they will have an illustrator create an exclusive character for you. More can be learned on their homesite, Hololive Productions, under vtuber auditions. The company employs a variety of content creators from around the world and supplies them with their own models. They can be seen as sort of a virtual idol company, and they usually stream on YouTube playing video games, singing, drawing or collaborating with other creators from Hololive. Each streamer has their own model with their own backstory and &quot;character&quot; they play while streaming. For example, Ninomae Ina'nis is a streamer I follow a little, you can see her model in figure 2. Her backstory according to the Hololive site is, &quot;Despite her looks, Ina'nis is actually a priestess of the Ancient Ones. One day, she picked up a strange book and then started to gain the power of controlling tentacles.&quot; Much of her streams are her drawing and talking to chat. This side of the Vtubing scene is a more professional side, the idols do not swear as much, and they report to managers as well as sticking to a schedule of streaming about three times a week. They are also not allowed to disclose much of their personal life and should stay &quot;in character&quot; throughout their streams. As far as I know, the company employs artists to create the Live2D models for the creators as well as creating new ones with different outfits. Recently, with the last update to live2D hololive has announced that they are updating their models. In an article on Siliconera they write, &quot;Hololive is getting a revamped Live2D version 3.0. The update will add more facial expressions and other features to its VTuber models' '. This shows how close the hololive company works with the live2D software. <br>
Along this vein of content creators, I would like to discuss a particularly talented independent vtuber known as Juniper Actias. She is in the genre of vtuber that creates her own model and creates content independent of an outside entity. Much of her streams are art streams and talking to chat. What caught my attention is the amazing detail and creativity in her model. As you can see in figure 3, this is the newest model she has put out. There are a variety of expressions she makes throughout her debut video as well as hand movements (assumingly animations) as well as changing forms. Her model is incredibly detailed and has so many moving parts and fluid motions, it is truly an amazing feat especially for one person to undertake. I chose this artist to show because I really think she is an excellent example of how much you can do in the Live2D program even without support from a larger entity.<br>
My final artist is one I do not know too much about personally, but I do like his model. This is the artist going by the name of RedClaw (fig 4). What stood out to me about this creator is that his model is not human, it's a dinosaur. This is another example of stretching the limits of the Live2D program, by creating something non humanoid. It is interesting to see how the animation of the character works as well as the amount of details on the model. RedClaw is another live streaming, self employed, vtuber and he shows the many different forms a vtuber can take.</p><br>

<p>While there has obviously been a large uptick in streaming content, there are other applications to the Live2D software as well. For example, back in 2017 Live2D held their annual creators conference in Akihabara. The article by Otakumode states, &quot;The panels included a screening of &quot;&quot;The Lamp Man,&quot; the very first short animated film created using Live2D by Live2D Creative Studio,&quot; (figure 5). This short really captures the strengths of the Live2D program as an animation tool. All the movements are fluid and the characters, despite being drawn in 2D, are able to move about three dimensionally. For example, there are many points where the lamp man completely turns 180 degrees, an incredible feat for animating a character without drawing multiple frames for it. The running animation is also incredibly well done, something that is notoriously hard to nail down in animation. </p><br>

<p>I can go on for days researching and finding all the ways to use this amazing program and that really speaks to the depth of Live2D Cubism. This software has really caught my attention and all the applications for it are truly exciting. We are so fortunate to live in an age with so many new artforms coming out within the digital space. I hope this dive into the Live2D program has enlightened you to research more about the software and learn to use it. Perhaps one day I'll see you livestreaming your model on Youtube!</p>

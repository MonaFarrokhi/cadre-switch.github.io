        A personal perspective on the advancements in technology and its impact on new media and hybrid digital art. It explores the beginning of the world wide web and the changes made to accelerate us into the future followed by the dark web and its negative impact on society. The possibilities of the world wide web opened multiple doors for artists to explore new media and create hybrid digital art. This article takes a look at some of the artwork that has been created with the technology at the time along with emerging hybrid digital art of from the present leading into the future.

                <h2><strong>Introduction:</strong></h2>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hybrid digital art of today has advanced in ways to make photorealistic digital images where we can&rsquo;t tell what is real or not. Photogrammetry is a great example of taking real life objects and digitizing them. The other possibility with the World Wide Web is crypto currency and the blockchain. Programs working together in a decentralized network. This was one of the optimistic predictions of Nicholas Negroponte, but there are also people who take advantage of technology and use it to commit fraud, steal information, etc. and the way information is used today is not the same as it was 10 years ago. Data has become vital to companies and advertisements. Facebook, Apple, Google, Amazon, TickTock, Instagram, etc all collect data on the things you &ldquo;like'', watch, and click on their applications and are able to target a certain audience to broadcast information to. It is continuously growing and the web seems to be forever changing. Our future of Hybrid digital art is being sold as NFT&rsquo;s or engaging in the Metaverse. It is still new to many but nonetheless it is here. </span></p>
                <h2><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Article:</strong></span></h2>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The world wide web was originally created to distribute information and speed up communication between scientists in universities and institutes around the world to meet the demand for automated information-sharing. Web 1.0 was created in 1989 and lasted until around 2005 and was considered a &ldquo;read-only&rdquo; web. The evolution of web 2.0 introduced user interaction from the general public. It was not only about reading and writing, but also creating. Almost twenty years later, we are beginning to see the evolution of web 3.0 which is being built on blockchain technology. Blockchain is an electronic distributed ledger that provides a digital record that is maintained without a central authority. AI technology such as Siri and Alexa are examples of what web 3.0 will be like.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The internet was very vulnerable when it began in 1989. The digital highway had many loopholes for hackers and cyberpunks to exploit. The term hacker was already being used in 1963 when an MIT article used the term in context for someone messing with the phone systems. The definition today is, &ldquo;someone who uses computers to gain unauthorized access to data.&rdquo; Mark Abene was famous for hacking into telephone systems using a normal phone receiver in the early 1990&rsquo;s as some people called him an underground hero and &ldquo;the Robin Hood of cyberspace&rdquo;. While the internet evolved, so did the people as William Gibson&rsquo;s cyberpunk idea became popular and began spreading among the online community.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hybrid digital art began to involve technology as a new media such as a dress made of computer microchips or VR goggles for you to interact in real time became a form of art. Jordan Lanier coined the term &ldquo;virtual reality&rdquo; and explained how the future of this technology may be. He was correct in predicting the use of virtual worlds and how some people will use it for work and others for play. The cyberpunks of the 90&rsquo;s was considered people who would take navigational control of cybernetic equipment for their own personal purpose. The community of cyberpunks believed all information should be free and promoted decentralization. These attacks on advanced technology were targeted at those who tried to restrict, direct, or control this technology. Net.art was another movement that arose in the 90&rsquo;s. Jodi.org was a website created by artists Joan Heemskerk and Dirk Paesmans, but the hidden messages depend on where you click. If you click the right link, you will be taken to what looks like a blueprint for a nuclear bomb, or maps of certain cities. What is unknown is if they are relatable. Nonetheless, the free information and data is there.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This battle between free information and restrictions has prompted the internet to advance even further with cyber securities and firewalls. Protecting your information is more important today with the rise of social media, online shopping, phishing scams, and cyber-attacks. The dynamics of the internet changed along with what people could do technically, but also aesthetically. In my opinion, the aesthetic of hybrid digital art is when an artist takes something ordinary and uses it in an unordinary way. Artists like Nam June Paik, Cory Arangel, and Ofir Shoham have worked with ordinary objects or videos and created something new for the art world.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Glitch art became popular in the late 1970&rsquo;s, but Arcangel took a different approach when he took a cartridge for the Super Mario game and exposed the ROM chip. There he modified the game so that it only displays the clouds moving across the screen. The calm aesthetic is like a cool glitch in the system depending on your definition of the word &ldquo;glitch&rdquo;. Glitch Art is a visual style characterized by using digital or analog error for aesthetic purposes, whether that be intentional or by accident. I like to call those &ldquo;happy accidents&rdquo;.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nam June Paik, who is internationally known as the &ldquo;Father of Video Art&rdquo;, was the first video artist ever who made us see video in a new way by transforming it into an artist&rsquo;s medium. His installation &ldquo;Phiber Optik&rdquo; paid homage to the online hacker Mark Abene who used that name as his pseudonym on the dark web. It was made of old tube televisions stacked together displaying different screens while riding a motorcycle and took on the presence of a giant being. As people and technology evolved, so did hybrid digital art and what we could do with it. Emerging artists are beginning to work with new software to create amazing digital content. Ofir Shoham is a digital artist who took old dance videos and added neon effects to enhance their moves or actions and created something new. As we progress into the future, I see the quality of graphics and video art evolving to augmented realities in real time, but that&rsquo;s just my prediction.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nicholas Negroponte predicted a lot of today&rsquo;s technology in 1984. He predicted CD-ROMs, touch sensitive screens, video teleconferencing, service kiosks, and his own effort to provide computers to children in developing countries. So far, everything has been true and has advanced even further with his &ldquo;1 laptop per child&rdquo; program. Recently, Negroponte spoke at a TED talk and explained how he is working to connect the last billion people in rural areas. He also gave a prediction that in 30 years, we will ingest information through the bloodstream to the brain. For example, someone can swallow a pill and learn another language.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Social media has evolved from AOL instant messenger, to websites like Friendster, Hi5, and Myspace, to applications like Instagram, Facebook, LinkedIn, and WhatsApp. The data that is collected on today&rsquo;s apps can be a risk to your privacy along with the free information that is on the internet already. One example is the teen who made a twitter that follows Elon Musk&rsquo;s jet (@ElonJet). It is a risky thing to do, but isn&rsquo;t all great art? It is as if the plane, Musk, and Twitter are the medium in this artwork.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The future of technology and hybrid digital art took a big step towards virtual realities again. Facebook announced its launch of Metaverse and people began buying virtual real estate. Companies like Nvidia, Epic Games, Microsoft, Apple, Roblox Corporation and Unity Software are all working on Metaverse and its developments. If we convert to web 3.0 in a decentralized network, then keeping track of verified digital assets such as crypto currencies and NFTs are where we&rsquo;re headed. It seems the cyberpunks of the 90&rsquo;s were ahead of their time and the predictions of a decentralized network aren't impossible. There are still things to be figured out but as cryptocurrency evolves so will the minds that plan to perfect it. As technology evolves, so will the people, including the artists who plan to create today&rsquo;s future of hybrid digital art.</span></p>
                <h2><strong>Conclusion:</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></h2>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If Facebook crashes with their Metaverse project, who will be the ones to inhabit that virtual world? I think the artists who create it will be the ones who inhabit it. Will China beat the U.S. with their new AR glasses that integrate the real world with digital art? As humans advance along with technology, so will hybrid digital art, it is possible that we are soon to see a world like the movie <em>Free Guy</em> starring Ryan Reynolds where we have AR glasses that make life like an alternate reality or spend all of our time in virtual worlds with haptic suits like the movie <em>Ready Player One.</em> If pills we ingest can make us smarter, will we advance even faster as a species? The possibilities are there for new ideas and new artworks.</span></p>

      <p>
Introduction: For the longest time video games have been connected by media outlets to violence, despite the numerous studies that reveal there is no definitive link between the two. What if the narrative was flipped and people had actually found out that video games could be used to reduce negative emotions such as stress, frustration, and anger, and even have physical benefits?
Even going further beyond this, there have been developments in video games created to help with more serious issues such as depression and anxiety, through electronic cognitive behavioral therapy. In addition, there has been an FDA approved treatment in improving attention function in children with ADHD by game developer Akili Interactive. Beyond this, VR is making waves as a form of exposure therapy, using visual representations to help reduce fear. In addition, it is also used for physiotherapy, creating challenging and engaging activities to improve motor skills.
1. Video games can be used to assist people with negative emotions. An example would be Sparx, an online game that is proven to help treat moderate depression, stress, or anxiety in young people. Through a psychotherapeutic approach called cognitive behavioral therapy Sparx helps to teach young people how to resolve issues. Other Games like Mindlight have been proven effective as a cognitive behavioral therapy program in reducing children’s anxiety.
 </p>
2. There are video games that have been used as a way to help with neurological conditions. EndeavorRx is the first FDA approved ADHD treatment for children, where it has been proven to improve attention function in ADHD patients. Video Games have also been shown to potentially help battle dementia in older adults. There have been studies that show Video Games improve social and motor skills and accepting mistakes in those on the autism spectrum.
 </p>
3. Virtual Reality can help improve motor skills and cognition as well as be used for exposure therapy. .Virtual Reality has large potential for use in physical therapy and emerging companies are highlighting this fact.inMotion VR is a company that uses Virtual reality technology to improve physical therapy. VR in general can provide exercises for physical therapy and neurological rehabilitation
 </p>
4. Physiotherapy games reveal how video games can be used to help with physical conditions. Speech Therapy Gamification Utilizes computer vision to detect facial movements and help with speech therapy. Project Fizzyo – Archipelayo is a Physiotherapy game designed for children with cystic fibrosis. The University of Alabama Birmingham has created physiotherapy for patients who have suffered from a stroke. Video games have been shown to help patients with less serious ailments chronic neck pain.
 </p>
5. Video games can help with rehabilitation by promoting adherence and engagement with the therapy. Many patients do not follow treatments prescribed by their doctors, resulting in as high as 70% non-adherence. Gamification of rehabilitation using VR has helped alleviate trauma experienced with treatment plans in burn victims. Innately, video games are engaging, though they need the help of healthcare professionals, video game designers, and engineers to truly be effective.
 </p>
6. Relying too much on video games as escapism may lead to addiction and other issues. Video games can be proven addictive if one becomes over reliant on them. Video games can lead to emotional loss, resulting in lack of emotional expression. A more serious form of this is called Alexithymia is a condition that may develop if video games are used to support avoidant behavior.
 </p>
7. Studies have shown that moderate and controlled gameplay can help reduce stress and frustration. In a study, prescribing video game play lowered patients’ anxiety more than adding a second medication to their treatment. Researchers found that playing puzzle games like Tetris could lower stress from a traumatic or stressful event. An fMRI study revealed that when you are experiencing fear or pain, that video games calm your amygdala, which are where feelings of fear or pain come from.

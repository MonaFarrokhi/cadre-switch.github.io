Video games have been associated with violence by many media outlets, but there is a discussion of the potential positive benefits that these forms of electronic entertainment can bring. There is an examination of games such as Sparx, Mindlight, Endeavor Rx, and Project Fizzyo that are game-based therapies. In addition, there is research in the potential use of VR for physiotherapy and neurological rehabilitation. Video games themselves are then discussed with how they assist in adherence to treatment and allievation of trauma. Lastly, there is a comparison of the potential negative effects that video games can have and how moderate gameplay can be a healthy way to release stress and frustration.      </p>

<!--       Example Paragraph with Hyperlink -->
      <p>
For the longest time video games have been connected by media outlets to violence, despite the numerous studies that reveal there is no definitive link between the two. What if the narrative was flipped and people had actually found out that video games could be used to reduce negative emotions such as stress, frustration, and anger.
Even going further beyond this, there have been developments in video games created to help with more serious issues such as depression and anxiety, through electronic cognitive behavioral therapy. In addition, there has been an FDA approved treatment in improving attention function in children with ADHD by game developer Akili Interactive. Beyond this, VR is making waves as a form of exposure therapy, using visual representations to help reduce fear. In addition, it is also used for physiotherapy, creating challenging and engaging activities to improve motor skills.
Regular video games themselves are therapeutic in a sense, providing stress relief in engagement and enjoyment through dopamine responses in our brains. Other positive outcomes from playing video games include: instant gratification, encouraging creativity, and social connection with peers. However, these benefits do not come without any risks, emotional suppression also known as alexithymia can occur as a result if games are overused for avoidant behavior like procrastination instead of as a healthy way to unwind. This can also lead to gaming addiction if they are the only coping mechanism players use.
 </p>
Video games can be used to assist people with negative emotions. An example would be Sparx, an online game originally launched June 25, 2013, that is proven to help treat moderate depression, stress, or anxiety in young people. Through a psychotherapeutic approach called cognitive behavioral therapy, Sparx helps to teach young people to challenge negative belief patterns through the development of healthy coping mechanisms when confronted with emotional conflicts. Sparx does this by creating in-game quests that teach players how to cope with techniques like controlled breathing and healthy ways to deal with their negative emotions through interaction with NPCs. Other Games like Mindlight have been proven effective as a cognitive behavioral therapy program in reducing children’s anxiety. Mindlight does this through neuro feedback mechanisms that regulate hormones that are associated with heightened anxiety levels.
 </p>
There are also video games that have been used as a way to help with other neurological conditions. EndeavorRx is the first FDA approved ADHD treatment for children, where it has been proven to improve attention function in ADHD patients. The game uses auditory and visual stimulation and motor activity in order to keep the attention of children with ADHD. In addition, EndeavorRx activates parts of the brain associated with attention function and integrates techniques that promote long term effects in heightening childrens’ abilities to pay attention to several things at the same time. Video Games have also been shown to potentially help battle dementia in older adults. Researchers have found that playing video games has been linked to improved cognitive health in adults when they played more challenging games that they were unfamiliar with. This study found that older adults that were immersed in a rich 3D environment and the entertainment value of video games are what contributed to this effect. There have also been studies that show video games improve social and motor skills and accepting mistakes in those on the autism spectrum. When it comes to social skills, online games allow those who are autistic interact through a digital interface in order to improve their communication before the intimidation that comes with in-person interactions. Games that require motion such as the Wii or Kinect on Xbox improve motor coordination as the character on the screen mimics the movements of the player. Lastly, video games show players that it is okay to make mistakes and lose, revealing how the consequences in the game are mistakes that everybody makes. 
 </p>
Beyond the screen, Virtual Reality can help improve motor skills and cognition as well as be used for exposure therapy. Through the use of digital environments within the headset, players are able to interact with things such as spiders without the risk of actually being with the physical animal or object. In addition, Virtual Reality has large potential for use in physical therapy and emerging companies are highlighting this fact. inMotion VR is a company that uses Virtual reality technology to improve physical therapy. VR in general can provide exercises for physical therapy and neurological rehabilitation, the technologies can be integrated with exercises in order to increase ease and the effectiveness of treatments.
 </p>
Other physiotherapy games reveal how video games can be used to help with physical conditions. Speech Therapy Gamification Utilizes computer vision to detect facial movements and help with speech therapy. This seeks to improve the tedium of practicing these mouth exercises as Jamie Bankhead had developed a game that recognized the motion of the mouth to make three common speech therapy exercises more entertaining. Another game he came up with was Project Fizzyo – Archipelayo, a Physiotherapy game designed for children with cystic fibrosis. Through the use of the Fizzyo sensor, the game takes breaths as inputs for the game. Through this physiotherapy the health risks of cystic fibrosis are reduced and life expectancy is improved. Video games have been shown to help patients with less serious ailments like chronic neck pain, using gamification exercises again to improve the adherence, which is discussed in the next paragraph..
 </p>
Video games can help with rehabilitation by promoting adherence and engagement with the therapy. Many patients do not follow treatments prescribed by their doctors, resulting in as high as 70% non-adherence. Gamification of rehabilitation using VR has helped alleviate trauma experienced with treatment plans in burn victims. Distracting them from their conditions and allowing them to freely enjoy something without reliving their trauma. Innately, video games are engaging, though they need the help of healthcare professionals, video game designers, and engineers to truly be effective.
 </p>
Relying too much on video games as escapism may lead to addiction and other issues. Alok Kanojia, youtube creator of HealthygamerGG is also a licensed psychologist. He revealed that video games can be proven addictive if one becomes over reliant on them, citing his own experience with this very issue. He recounted how he became over reliant on video games as a coping mechanism andit became his only form of escapism. Video games can lead to emotional loss, resulting in lack of emotional expression. A more serious form of this is called Alexithymia is a condition that may develop if video games are used to support avoidant behavior.
 </p>
Studies have shown that moderate and controlled gameplay can help reduce stress and frustration. In a study, prescribing video game play lowered patients’ anxiety more than adding a second medication to their treatment. Researchers found that playing puzzle games like Tetris could lower stress from a traumatic or stressful event. An fMRI study revealed that when you are experiencing fear or pain, that video games calm your amygdala, which are where feelings of fear or pain come from. Overall, while video games have been associated with bad press, there are undeniable studies that reveal the untapped potential that video games can be used in a beneficial way.

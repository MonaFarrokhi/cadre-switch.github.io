      <p>
     This article explores the relationship between art, technology, and the future through speculation, as well as research. Beginning with modern day controversies in the art world such as NTF's and the Metaverse, and going on to how the influence of media affects the develpoment of technology and ideologies, it is explored what the future may hold for humanity if we, as a species, are not careful during the creative processes of art and technology. This goes into the creation of smart AI, the motives to create such a technology, and the potential consequences of doing so, such as weapons of greater mass destruction and robot dystopias.

        Article Body
      </h2>
	  
	<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Art influences all minds of society. Whether or not one may know it, everything that they consume has an aspect of art that affects their mind. This comes with its cons, however, in that not all art represents an impeccable society. Greedy corporations may at times want to manipulate what they show to consumers in the pursuit of riches, so we, as artists, have a responsibility as influencers to pave the way for society, and be careful of what we show. Art can show us the future; powerful ideas in art will have influence on those who consume it and bring forth similar ideas.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are many problems already occurring in terms of art and technology, which is what the future may be leading up to. Some technological advances may be, on the surface, intriguing and impressive, but are at times not always ethical. Take, for example, the Tupac hologram performance at Coachella in 2012. (Fig. 1) Of course, it was a sight to see such a realistic representation of the diseased artist, but it brings up many questions. &ldquo;Would Tupac even want this?&rdquo; &ldquo;To whom do the profits made from the performance go towards?&rdquo; &ldquo;Is it morbid to show someone who has passed on as a performance for others?&rdquo; These are but a few of the questions one must think about in one particular circumstance of technological advancements in art, yet they seem to have been overruled by how awesome it would be to have Tupac perform again.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some of the more recent controversies seem more capitalistic in nature while just as intrusive. Amongst these are NFT&rsquo;s (Non-Fungible Tokens) and the talks of a &ldquo;Metaverse.&rdquo; NFT&rsquo;s, at first, seemed to be an excellent way for artists to sell art in a secure and absolute way. However, as time went on, more problems seemed to arise. One negative aspect of NFT&rsquo;s is its lack of environmental safety. It is estimated that the amount of energy required to create and sell one NFT can reach up to 175 MWh of power, equivalent to an average U.S. household&rsquo;s greenhouse emissions for over 20 years. In addition, the security of these NFT&rsquo;s do not seem to be as enforced as customers may like. It has become popular internet culture to screenshot these NFT&rsquo;s as partakers in this practice have discovered that there is little to no consequence to do so, essentially creating an easier way to steal art.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Metaverse is a concept currently in development which is trying to create a virtual world in which one may have a convincing second life out of reality. Some of the concerns with this include the invasion of privacy, as well as cyberbullying and/or harassment. These topics, as well as many others, have already been explored with certain media, such as the Japanese anime, Sword Art Online, as well as an American movie, &ldquo;Ready Player One.&rdquo; With Facebook being the company responsible for the Metaverse, many do not feel confident in their privacy, especially when Facebook has a track record of stealing and selling its consumers&rsquo; information. As for cyberbullying and harassment, the concern is prominent, as internet culture already includes this; amplified by Metaverse&rsquo;s desire to create a compelling second reality, the results could be catastrophic. However, with it being the only one of its kind at the moment, the Metaverse will have a monopoly in its product, leading people who want this type of experience to have no choice but to indulge in this product and its potential malpractices.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is no secret that the Metaverse has been influenced by media created by artists. So, with this, it is possible that other forms of compelling media could influence the creation of real life technology. This is concerning as it seems that humanity does not heed its own warnings. We see in the things that we consume, how a certain type of technology is able to produce unwelcomed, terrible results, yet it does not stop someone from making it a reality. For example, dystopian societies in novels or other media often depict a broken world, their citizens unable to practice free will, as well as unable to escape. We see now in some parts of the world, this exact scenario. The environmental crises in terms of global warming and nature&rsquo;s wellbeing are close to becoming irreversible. In China, citizens are unable to practice free speech, and are ruled by dictatorship. Between the United States and Mexico, there have been talks about robot dogs to patrol the border (Fig. 3). There are so many signs of much of the world going into a dystopian state that we have already seen and know, yet it is still continued.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Artificial Intelligence, or AI, is another matter which brings up many questions. If it is true intelligence and consciousness, does this mean AI would need to have rights? Or would they still be seen as objects because they are artificial nonetheless? Is it moral to bring this type of consciousness into existence without permission? Is true artificial consciousness even possible? What reason do we have to even create this type of technology? These types of questions are explored in much of media, including the videogame &ldquo;Detroit Become Human (Fig. 2),&rdquo; the TV show, &ldquo;WestWorld,&rdquo; and even the classic movie, &ldquo;The Terminator.&rdquo; In these universes, the AI they use are put into physical bodies of human form, and are used as slaves, whether it be for entertainment or otherwise. The conversation is complex and causes much controversy throughout the entire world in each respective franchise, yet, this still seems to be the goal, as seen with the &ldquo;dumb&rdquo; AI we have now such as Siri, Cortana, Alexa, etc. It seems like these were used as prototypes for the smart AI that all these problems pertain to.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The next question is &ldquo;When does it end?&rdquo; Will the world inevitably enter an apocalypse that ends humanity? There are nations that have had weapons of mass destruction for nearly a century now, and with time, these weapons can only advance, growing more powerful and being more devastating. With the influence and creativity of the media, it would be no surprise if the government takes inspiration in creating chemical warfare that creates a zombie apocalypse or something of the like.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though the situation may seem bleak, there are many preventative measures we can take as a species. Depending on the issue one wants to face, there can be a lot of research to be done, however, the most important part is to spread awareness of the dangers of some of what is being fought for, as well as what we should do as a collective. With the proper precautions, we can advance technologically as a society without damaging the Earth and our species.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are many advancements in technology that are influenced by art. There are also many malpractices occurring today in terms of art, which could lead to larger problems, not only in the art world, but in the entire world. However, if we proceed with caution and heed the warnings that many pieces of media teach, we may be able to stop the death of the planet and of humanity, and become a more advanced, yet peaceful and healthy society.</span></p>

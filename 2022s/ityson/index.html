Since the birth of computers, humans have envisioned a time where the machine aids or even replaces our physical being. We’ve seen incredible advancements in the fields of cybernetics, biofeedback, and now in the creation of art - an ability thought only to be done by conscious, living beings. But we must beg the question: is AI generated imagery actually considered art?

Let us begin with understanding what AI generated art is and how it has gained prevalence in the modern art world. AI programs have been around for years in forms such as Chatbots - where the computer’s responses are based on an algorithm and feedback determined by the human’s message. AI generative art is similar. According to Artnet’s article “How Did A.I. Art Evolve?...”, artists have been working with AI to create art  “using various kinds of neural networks—the interconnected layers of processing nodes, modeled loosely on the human brain—as well as machine learning techniques such as evolutionary computation” (22). The first of these generative programs was created in 2014, but generative art hit the mainstream in 2015 via Google’s DeepDream program. This is a perfect name in my opinion due to how surreal and dreamlike the images created are (Fig.1). The images created by AI tend to have a Monet-esc style to them - appearing clear as one squints but chaotic and a tad bit horrifying as one looks close. The work produced by DeepDream tends to have aesthetic features of animals, eyes, and rainbows. Other programs that have evolved from this initial jump such as Disco Diffusion which produces a more concise image - and one of originality (Fig.2)      </p>

Now, originality is an important topic to address when exploring generative art. As the name suggests, the art must be generated from somewhere - and for AI it is done through “style transfer”. This, in layman's terms, means the AI is fed images by a human counterpart and is told to spit out a new image inspired by the stylistic choices from the input(s). So is this actually creativity? Would this be considered art - after all the computer’s creation is based solely on algorithmic data. In “The Relationship Between Art and AI”, author Jennifer Aue explains that humans create art “to evoke an emotional response, to recall past events and emotions, to communicate, and to educate” (1). Later in the article she addresses that while AI acts as an impersonator, so do many artists: “You don’t press a button and something looks amazing. I’ve learned the quirks and the personality traits of the algorithm” (12). All artists take inspiration and work off of what we like; it is the natural artmaking process to use a culmination of styles and build our own work. Our mind works like a computer - or vice versa. It is my opinion that AI generative art is Art. It is also a collaboration between man and machine as the human inputs what the computer is to analyze and create from. In as recent as March 2022, we’re seeing programs such as “Midjourney” which sharpens the clarity of AI art even further (with a much stronger style transfer). The artist that drew my interest in AI art: Andrei Riabovitchev, has been using this program to create an immense collection of visually powerful works (Fig.3)

Riabovitchev’s AI generated works fascinate me with their aesthetic references to cyber-religious topics. Quite a few of the pieces resemble classical religious paintings of the Renaissance, which I find intriguing as we are now living in a time of technological expansion reminiscent of that time. As previously mentioned, the nature of modern generative art is Monet-esc - being clear from afar and confusing as one looks closer at the work. Many of the pieces being made currently remind me of the famous piece “Garden of Earthly Delights” by Hieronymus Bosch because of the sheer detail within the images. The themes of space, nebulas, religion, hypnotism, and lovecraftian horror are also inspiring to me as an artist. I find AI generative art to be such a powerful aspect in society because of its prevalence on social media. We even see AI art being made for NFT purposes. This exposure and ease of accessibility for the programs lends to a boom in creativity overall - as shown in my work recently being inspired by the creative visuals I’ve seen from artists like Riabovitchev.
